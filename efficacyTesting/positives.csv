review
I went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine Ill admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy I was wrong Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions This one did exactly that The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying This movie was great and I suggest that you go see it before you judge
My boyfriend and I went to watch The GuardianAt first I didnt want to watch it but I loved the movie- It was definitely the best movie I have seen in sometimeThey portrayed the USCG very well it really showed me what they do and I think they should really be appreciated moreNot only did it teach but it was a really good movie The movie shows what the really do and how hard the job isI think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary It was a great movie all around I would suggest this movie for anyone to seeThe ending broke my heart but I know why he did it The storyline was great I give it 2 thumbs up I cried it was very emotional I would give it a 20 if I could!
My yardstick for measuring a movies watch-ability is if I get squirmy If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore the film is too long This movie did not even come close to being boring Predictable in some parts sure but never boringbr br All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated until the day your boat sinks that isbr br The movie was very enjoyable and fun Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesnt know when to quit However I was most impressed by Ashton Kutchers performance I have never liked him never watched any of his TV shows and always considered him an immature  well punk In this film he does a great job! He is well on his way to having leading-man status I think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something because about 23 of the way in the film stock turned very grainy the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place Also at the viewing were representatives from the movie looking for audience feedback - particularly on the parts of the film we didnt likebr br POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife Sela Ward packing her stuff up and moving out He says Maybe I should be the one to move out And she replies No you dont know where anything is in this house; I should be the one to go This doesnt make sense: If she knows the layout so well Costner is right he should be the one to leave
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this? I cant count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint I was reminded so often of other movies it became a big distraction One of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow One line by itself is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad riskbr br BUTbr br See The Movie! Despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever While borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard In fact youll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out Why? Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well I have never been a fan of Kutchers and I nearly gave up on him in The Guardian but he surfaced in good fashion Costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of Costners ability I dont think Mrs Robinson had anything to do with his successbr br The supporting cast all around played their parts well I had no problem with any of them in the end But some of these characters were used too muchbr br From here on out I can only nit-pick so I will save you the wear and tear Enjoy the movie the parts that work work well enough to keep your head above water Just dont expect a smooth ridebr br 7 of 10 but almost a 6
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see itbr br I was caught off guard with the high quality of the film I couldnt image Ashton Kutcher in a serious role but his performance truly exemplified his character This movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support unlike so many other movies It does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie but in this case I highly recommend that everyone see itbr br This films is Truly Exceptional!
I only went to see this movie because I have always liked Kevin Costner I felt that Ashton did a great job in the Butterfly Effect Unfortunately even though these two actors wereare capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here Some of the scenes were just not believable and didnt have enough story line supportbr br Though the movie claims influence from the hurricane Katrina aftermath there was very little (none) to that effect in the moviebr br Overall I liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspectivebr br The special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating Not sure Ill ever go deep sea fishing againbr br I expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presentedbr br Definitely a movie that couldve been seen on DVD
I was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre-release last night and though I wasnt expecting to actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part The rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living The weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes Im not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of An Officer and a Gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertastebr br Like I said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clichés
Our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed The Guardian Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake After seeing this movie you cant help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescuesbr br Even though this is a fictional movie it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U S Coast Guardbr br The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible You actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescuebr br I feel the movie could have been made without the Hollywood bar scene (when you see the movie you might agree) since the real Coast Guard does not condone such behavior br br Very entertaining very action packed definitely worth seeing Thank you U S Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers So Others May Live Id highly recommend this movie to everyone
Im a Petty Officer 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard There were only a few scenes that were far fetched The most far-fetched was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessels captain out of the engine room that would never happen Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances Second the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak) it looked more like a NASA command center we dont have any gear that hi-tech Third the Captain of the Airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases with like 10 people on watch In reality it would be an E-6 or E-7 as the SAR Controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist SAR Controller & a Radio Watchstander Otherwise the movie was dead on I think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the CG and their roles in search & rescue instead of just Aviation based rates Some of the scenes from A school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff I did and got in trouble for in my younger days
Ive seen this story before but my kids havent Boy with troubled past joins military faces his past falls in love and becomes a man The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and dont generate enough heat to melt butter he compliments Costner well I never really understood Sela Ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted Costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs But her presence on screen is a pleasure The two unaccredited stars of this movie are the Coast Guard and the Sea Both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie The movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships But it still works The rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact This movie earns the audience applause And the applause of my two sons
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film I would have told you it was great! However I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied After thinking a little about it I believe the problem was the pace of the ending I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow and then the ending developed very fast So I would say the ending left me disappointedbr br I thought that the characters were well developed Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! Also the different relationships between the characters seemed very real FurthermoreI thought that the different plot lines were well developed Overall it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing itbr br In conclusion: Good Characters Great Plot Poorly WrittenEdited Ending Still Go See It!!!
I was looking forward to The Guardian but when I walked into the theater I wasnt really in the mood for it at that particular time Its kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy itbr br Im not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit The trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld Plus despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect Im still not completely sold on him Something about the guy just annoys me Probably has to do with his simian featuresbr br It took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission and I was gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers orange face lift My concerns briefly bristled at Kutchers initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious Sunglasses a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin a smirk thatd make George Clooney proud? Yeah we get it I was totally ready to hate himbr br But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs br br Darn you ape man! Efficiently mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting The Guardian is easily a film that I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy You can quibble about its clichés predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness but none of that takes away from the entertainment valuebr br I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated groupbr br Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival And if all that isnt bad enough sometimes you cant save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who diesbr br Man who wants all that responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought Id have an Ashton KutcherKevin Costner movie to thank for the education? br br Not only does The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customersbr br THE GIST br br Moviegoers wanting an inside look at what its like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance I saw it for free but had I paid I wouldve felt I had gotten my moneys worth
I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theaterbr br We have all seen this plot line before (Top Gun GI Jane An Officer and a Gentleman) but a good script still works This story is basically about the training of a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines Kevin Costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader Ben Randall who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission The movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the Costner character and that of Jake Fischer played by Ashton Kutcher I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this partbr br There are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives However the use of humor the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching Ben Randall do his own thing as a trainer kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud gasp here and there and clap at the end as a tribute to the moviebr br We all had a good time (despite a couple of tough moments in the movie)and I think you will too
I work at a movie theater and every Thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next dayToday it was The Guardian I saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie Well turns out this movie was a lot more than I would have thought It was a great story first of all Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did amazing acting work in this film Being a big fan of That 70s Show I always found it hard thinking of Kutcher as anyone but Kelso despite the great acting he did in The Butterfly Effect but after seeing this movie I think I might be able to finally look at him as a serious actorbr br It was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the US Coast Guard
I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films While the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the films most unforgettable emotional moment The specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibilityto save lives at sea The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowingI havent seen such angry seas since The Perfect Storm Co-star Clancy Brown (HBOs Carnivale - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guards Kodiak Alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins The film wonderfully and finally gives long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; it had the audience applauding at the end
As others that have commented around the web Im a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard Having said that and being the skeptic I am I went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors There was some cheese but all in all not much and the film was pretty accuratebr br I watched the trailer again today After seeing the film yesterday Ive realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes This isnt the casebr br The movie is truly more characterstory driven than action The inner struggles both Costner and Kutcher are dealing with Kutchers is revealed further into than movie than Costners isbr br Of course there is a minor love story no surprise there But for the most part the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together and after some time help each other heal old woundsbr br As girlie as it sounds Costner and as much as I try not to like him Kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the moviebr br As critics have stated youve seen it all before Top Gun Officer and a Gentlemen etc But what movie hasnt been remade a million timesbr br I can recall only one F word being spoken and cant really recall any other languagebr br The movie is 2+ hours and for some may tend to get a little long towards the endbr br Youll laugh you may cry but I can honestly say it was worth the $4 I paidbr br I hope you enjoy the movie
I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines mindless plot and the kind of nauseous acting that made The Postman one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time But I was shocked Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions Not since Robin Hood have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in Butterfly Effect These two actors came into this film with a serious focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films Ive seen this year No its not an Oscar worthy movie Its not an epic or a profound social commentary film Rather its a story about a simple topic illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible Thats what I think good film-making is and I for one am throughly impressed by this work Bravo!
Brilliant and moving performances by Tom Courtenay and Peter Finch
The Dresser is perhaps the most refined of backstage films The film is brimming with wit and spirit for the most part provided by the energetic character of Norman (Tom Courtenay) Although his character is clearly gay and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (Albert Finney) that he assists the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it isbr br The gritty style of Peter Yates that worked so well in Bullitt is again on display and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence This is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious In the end The Dresser will bore many people silly but it will truly be a delight to those who love British cinemabr br 77 out of 10
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies My only quibble is that the director Peter Yates had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene but the performances were so great I forgive himbr br Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely marvelous; brilliant The script is great giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during World War II (and therefore what it was like in the 30s as well) Lots of great subtle touches lots of broad overplayed strokes all of it perfectly done Scene after scene just blows me away and then theres the heartbreaking climax
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our Community Cinema and it got an overall average score of 86 Wed 100% recommend it then for todays audiences especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen and can talk about it with others afterwards as our audience didbr br The sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding Of course Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars but everybody was thoroughly well cast For our afternoon audience the majority of whom are senior citizens the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non-techy use of camera and sound was a great influencebr br How delightful many said to see a really great film thats British: still not dated twenty years on: not full filled with blood & guts: not confusing because of bob-about-all-over-the-place camera shots and back and forth through time story lines: no seedy sex scenes Such views were even uttered by some who were younger
The Dresser is a small but absolutely wonderful film brilliantly acted by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay How in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major Academy Award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me but its nice to know the Academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while (of course they gave the award that year to Terms of Endearment-- after all they dont want to be accused of showing TOO much taste)br br Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of King Lear; Tom Courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights Its both hilarious and piteous to see Courtenays character showering Finneys with attention and affection only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed even up to the very bitter end Finney and Courtenay work wonders together and though Finney gets the showiest moments (he does get to recite Shakespeare after all) Courtenay is the heart and soul of the filmbr br Grade: A
What is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews I have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film While Courtenays character is evidently gay he is not the only one: the often talked about Mr Davenport-Scott is the other and the reason that he is never seen the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in England at the timebr br We can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled Norman Courtenays character: and we can also see in a passing remark by Oxenby the Edward Fox character the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved: the fear of association affects many of the characters and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it The abandonment of Courtenay at the end by Sir has been anticipated all the way through if this subtext is included: it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to The flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that Courtenay has to step into the footlights as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the mans inner tormentbr br So while the drama is of the decline of Finneys Sir a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the fatal flaw of Courtenays gayness and makes this a film about him as the title suggestsbr br The art direction pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time more distant than the eighties and in some ways even than the second world war The implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre; and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant for all its flaws

This is a movie that deserves another look--if you havent seen it for a while or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983) Based on a play by the same name it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring Shakespearean repertory company in England during World War II It deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young able bodied ones being taken for military service It also deals with his relationship with various members of his company especially with his dresser So far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth While tragic overall the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout The two male leads both received Oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama theater--especially Shakespeare or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity The backstage goings-on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers
This film has its detractors and Courtneys fey dresser may offend some folks (who frankly need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging poignant relevant Finney naturally is larger than life Courtney makes an ideal foil I thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads and Courtneys character provides plenty of dark humor The period is well captured the supporting cast well chosen This is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial I only wish it were out on DVD already(sigh)
Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser Of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre and I think you listen better in theatre; but on the screen we become more intimate were up-close more than we are in the theatre we witness subtle changes in expression we see better as well as listen Both the play and the movie are wondrous: moving intelligent illuminating--of the backstage story of the company of historical context of the two main characters and of the parallel characters in Lear itself If you cannot get to see it in a theatre (I dont imagine its produced much these days) then please do yourself a favor and get the video
A fantastic cinema experience I really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out There is nothing to add except that is a terrible shame that sir Albert Finney still isnt accepted by the AMPAS (American Academy) After roles in such films as Tom Jones Murder on the Orient Express Under the Volcano (to name only few - for these he was nominated for the Oscar) The Dresser is arguably his highlight yetbr br I know Oscars are just popularity contest but if Americans like British actors and actresses (and the Oscar goes to Jeremy Irons Daniel Day-Lewis Anthony Hopkins Emma Thompson Glenda Jackson etc - and they all deserved the award!) why they always left sir Finney with empty hands?br br On the other hand they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny) I dont know should I laugh or crybr br If you have seen the two leads in The Dresser you wont forget what is the art of acting Watch this film and enjoy! I recommend it to everyone who loves artbr br I give 910 for this excellent film (1 point missing for non-cinematic material after all it is just a theater)br br Note: My criteria is much stronger than this on IMDb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that shouldcould last forever)
br br What more can you ask for? A great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century two fine emotional performances by Courtney and Finney a realistic vision of war time london a great supporting cast This film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour sadness loss and fulfillment if you are in the theatre it is even more effective This is a true 10 on the rating scale !
The Dresser is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary Donald Wolfit) it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlightsbr br As Sir the overbearing actor and main focus of the play Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the blow winds  bit of King Lear or chatting to his faithful stage manager Madge (Eileen Atkins good as ever) about the old times As Norman his camp dresser Tom Courtenay gives a fabulous performance wiggling around at the beck and call of Lear collecting a bottle to go at the pub or bitchily disparaging the former Fool Mr Davenport-Scott (often mentioned but never seen!)br br In an engaging support cast theres Edward Fox as Oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead) Zena Walker as her Ladyship Lockwood West as the replacement Fool and many othersbr br This film has great energy bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins it is true but being so well-acted you dont notice Very well done indeed
I just watched The Dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years agobr br Its not a big movie and doesnt try to make a big splash but my God the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this moviebr br The Dresser is the story of Sir an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney) and his dresser Norman (Courtenay) sort of a valet putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II These are two men each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anywaybr br This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life Finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when theyre taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer Employer is really the wrong term to use though For although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couplebr br Yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are Finney Courtenay and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood That is not to say that there arent other fine performances most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have beenbr br Although it doesnt get talked about these days it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay Best Picture Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplaybr br I had remembered this as being a good movie but I wasnt prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then I encourage you to see The Dresser
LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fine stage play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen This brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors fine music brilliant editing superb direction by George C Wolfe and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory! Yes it is just that goodbr br The story is based on the authors life as the child Junior (Marcus Carl Franklin) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic Rachel Nanny Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson) a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the South from mental hospitals and from the streets to Lackawanna New York The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny The myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business: Terrence Howard Rosie Perez Mos Def the beautiful Carmen Ejogo Louis Gossett Jr Jeffrey Wright Ernie Hudson Charlayne Woodward Jimmy Smits Patricia Wettig Macy Gray Liev Schreiber Kathleen Chalfant Lou Myers Hill Harper - the list goes on and onbr br In the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism the history of desegregation the dynamics of drug abuse and violence the infectious joy of African American music contributions to our musical culture and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact S Epatha Merkerson is wholly submerged in this role a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos She offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an HBO movie she without a doubt would add the Oscar to place along side her Golden Globe awardbr br The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues jazz dancing and joy The production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story Highly Recommended almost Compulsory Viewing!

Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson) Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her but she could have just as easily been called Wonder Woman She epitomized strength will power confidence and resolve She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject Her tenants consisted of a lesbian a psychotic war veteran an amputee and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary Each successive event Rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly She wasnt a dictator devoid of compassion but in fact she was quite the opposite She displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herselfbr br Merkerson did a good job but I believe this role was right up her alley anyway The movie had an even keel never straying from Rachel There were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected Nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than Rachel herself
Lackawanna Blues is a touching story about Nanny a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need Its told from the viewpoint of a boy taken in by Nanny when his own mother isnt quite up to the taskbr br I have respect for this movie for three main reasons: 1) It is touching but not sappy Its told in a very real fashion without a lot of the aggravating Hollywood storytelling baggage And the ending is quite good (teary but not over-the-top)br br 2) Although its clearly an African-American film being set in the post-segregation black community of Lackawanna New York it doesnt wear its ethnicity on its sleeve The story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) surrounding their lives Its not preachy its simply goodbr br 3) It has a great soundtrack (cant beat old-school R&B and Chicago blues)br br Generally the acting is strong but not universally so Some of the performances simply dont hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray But considering it was a made-for-TV movie thats to be expectedbr br 8 out of 10 Imperfect but likable good film for a rainy day
Every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love A film where you see people you know portrayed on screen Its cinema very at its bestbr br Lackawanna Blues is that film Set in 1960s upstate New York the story surrounds a rock- solid woman who is the foundation for her community This based on a true story film is told from a child she accepted as her own This child Ruben Santiago-Hudson wrote the screenplaybr br Emmy winner S Epatha Merkerson stars as Nanny a woman who has wit drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home She does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover Bill Crosby played by the Oscar nominated Terrence Howard br br But make no mistake; see this film for the amazing performance of Merkerson who is brilliant in this role She encompasses a person we have all known and perhaps lovebr br Lackawanna Blues is already on DVD; be sure to pick it up at your local video story todaybr br Merkerson has already won an Emmy Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild for this rolebr br Howard has an Oscar nomination for his role in Hustle & Flow
LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining engrossing emotionally-charged HBO-TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a small role) This joyous motion picture experience is centered around Santiago-Hudsons childhood guardian Rachel Nanny Crosby a strong big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate New York during the 1950s Nanny was a one-woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks derelicts cripples drug addicts misfits and everyone else in town who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out The crux of the story revolves around Nannys relationship with young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin)a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so Nanny took him in S Epatha Merkeson who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of Lieutenant Van Buren on NBCs LAW & ORDER turns in a powerhouse performance as Nanny the neighborhood mother-figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award Merkeson is backed by an impressive all-star cast that includes Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as Nannys husband) Louis Gossett Jr Rosie Perez Jimmy Smits Delroy Lindo Macy Gray Michael K Williams Jeffrey Wright Henry Simmons Patricia Wettig Ernie Hudson Mos Def and Hill Harper as the adult Ruben Colorful and exciting beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels but if for no other reason is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by S Epatha Merkeson who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it
This is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times Ill go so far as to put it up there with Ray and The Aviator It is the story of a young bi-racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing Miss Rachael aka Nanny You will fall in love with Nanny a woman who gives all of herself to those around her S Epatha Merkerson brings the character to life beautifully and the other cast members are do the same If I were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles Id have to mention everyone in the entire cast br br The music in this film perfectly blends with the story almost dictates the way it goes And whats more this film is actually entertaining It wont bore you at all not even for a minute! br br I highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend an evening at home watching a very smart very entertaining quality film
S Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago Jr (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under the guardianship of Nanny The film gives a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture lifes ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film The supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def Macy Gray Terrence Dashon Howard Rosie Perez Louis Gossett Jr Liev Schreiber Jimmy Smits Ernie Hudson Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig Loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling But overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by Merkerson
Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lees Shes Gotta Have It I have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatementbr br Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed She was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again I first saw Macy Grays name in the credits and went ho-hum Her performance was so good I didnt even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through I am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in African-American culture that is very tastefully donebr br Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choicesbr br This is a worthy elegant presentation of African-American life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic You owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collectionbr br I highly recommend
Lackawana Blues An impressive HBO movie about a beautiful woman that made her house a home for several charactersTouchingaliveentrancing-a great mix of sound and story- based on a true story featuring an All-Star castA time capsule about br br you get the point and no I am not on the payola for the HBO crew- I would throw around more superlatives but I am about to go out  The extras on the DVD include a deleted scenea featurette and commentaryThe funniest part about the featurette was star lighting they used when interviewing exec producer Halle Berrybr br OK seriously - good times A
What a wonderful film filled with eccentric unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast The director also did a great job keeping the story held together getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect S Epatha in the lead role is great I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is and although I have enjoyed her on Law and Order this really shows what she can do with a filled out complex role Macy Gray is terrific Mos Def as usual wonderful Lou Gossett great Jimmy Smits terrific and doesnt try to pull focus because hes a star A true piece of ensemble acting br br Rent it enjoy it groove to it and treasure it Something special
This is one of those movies that you just dont want to end The characters are rich like a well woven tapestry Colorful costumes music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War A young man is taken in by a dynamic big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiencesbr br I couldnt believe this was a made for television film It was so well executed S Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as Nanny and she brings so much life to this role You want to be right there amongst her boardersbr br I enjoyed this film so much I bought the DVD
One of the bestLackawanna Bluesbr br Great moviegreat castgreat musicthis is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutesI will w3atch this one many times br br This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role You get the sense that youre really there taking all this in A great deal of care was given in the sets costumes and music of the period The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on but the steady performance of Ms Merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before weve had our fill of the wonderful misfits To single out anyone other than Nanny is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including:br br Jeffery Wright Jimmy Smits Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo But it is Marcus Franklin Macy Gray and Ms Merkerson that makes this a wonderful experiencebr br The movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards but it is without question one of the best movies youre going to see this year If you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally tug at your heart lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time then this is the movie for you Ive shown it to several friends and they all want my copy that says it all the movie is that good Check it out for yourselfbr br danceability-1 Amsterdam Holland
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people br br Its editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seenbr br The music really tied into the story which made the characters come to life The editing made the story more progressive and captivating br br I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast most notably S Epatha Merkersonsbr br I cant wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer Ruben Santiago-Hudson
Just a great soundtrack Really enjoyable music Outstanding cast great lead performance Worth watchingbr br Doesnt really explain what happened to the neighborhood You are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegratedbr br This movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wrightbr br The cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music food drink dancing gambling and sex
I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO It is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale I was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played Nanny She is an outstanding actress Of course my favorite actor is Terrance Howard He is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received Ebony magazine did do a nice article on him giving him some of his due propers Lakawanna Blue gave me a understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us They were from a similar town Philadelphia PA were they had to have their fun in the junt joints and such I also like to say that Mos Def is a incredible actor He has found his calling Ive seen him in several movies where he has played a variety of roles from thug to doctor and he has the stuff! Overall please put Lakawanna Blues on video for rental
Lackawanna Blues is and excellent movie The casting was perfect Every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played Their chemistry together was amazing The acting was superb I felt as if i knew the characters I could almost feel them They reminded me of people that I knew as a child growing up in the 50s and 60s Oh the memories!! My personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see I have watched this movie so many times that I can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them I cant even list my favorite part because I have SO MANY favorite parts Thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that I never see in this day and ageand that is Black people loving each other looking out for each other respecting each other caring about each other and doing all we can to help each other Gotta go now I have to go watch it again
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on It brings back happy times for me I grow up in a big city in the mid-west It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost The big mamas of day are under the age of 55 Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past The music was great in this movie I truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters I would have paid to see it As I viewed the movie for the second time I figured out who life this movie was about He did an superb job in writing and producing this film I guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you As soon as I can I will be obtaining a copy for my home use I alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than Thanks for such a great movie
Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy The film clearly supports it takes a village to raise a child and reminds of an important time in black history and culture I gained an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress Her character was a little crazy yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like Macys character S Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress Law & Order never showcased the depth of Epathas acting abilities like Lackawanna Blues I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhoodit was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane I truly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the DVD release to add to my collection
Fantastically written acted and produced! Loved seeing this gleaming talented cast -- every single one of them -- give a such great performance This movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart! Great storytelling!br br This is a great movie for Black History month Full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain -- with dignity and a belief in a better future It is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adulthood The next time youre in the company of a listening and observing child remember; show or he may be a writer-in-the-making!
This was absolutely one of the best movies Ive seen br br Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and backbr br I couldnt help but care about the characters Ms Merkerson will blow you away as will the young man playing the young leadbr br I also thought that the set design was top-rate The viewer is really placed inside each era as its presented br br The music is a blast too Nice selections to represent mood time and place The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs br br This is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings Take the time to watch it!
This is a must-see movie You will laugh you will cry and when its over youll wish there were more Well-written and compelling this movie draws you in and holds on tight The casting was perfect the characters purposeful and the performances outstanding Nanny is the standard to which all women should hold themselves: strong forgiving protective and never judgmental Nanny to me is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community If I were half the woman Nanny is I might consider myself to be doing okay I would have been devastated if Nanny had died at some point in the movie but since she didnt I will definitely buy this when it comes out on DVD I can only hope that the story continues and that Ruben goes back to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the town piece by piece and person by person
This movie was very good not great but very good It is based on a one man play by Ruben Santiago Hudsonyes he played most of the parts On paper it looks like stunt casting Yes lets round up all the black folks in Hollywood and put them in one movie Halle Berry even produced it The only name I didnt see was Oprahs thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a Hallmark movie Instead this movie was not some sentimental mess It was moving but not phony the characters came and went with the exception of her husband Pauline and the writer in question The movie revolved around the universe of Nanny Mrs Bill Crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people Now being a jaded New Yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man Im thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going Getting folks jobs and taking the medicarecaid checks But no she explains to Lou Gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time I think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded New Yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folks(g) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal(g) She almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes I can see why She is married to a neer do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her Terrence Howard was born to play these type of parts He was good but I would like to see him play something different Markerson who plays Nanny is also very good But for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright Where is this mans Oscar? He already won a Emmy and a Tony He was in Shaft and he stole the movie I did not even know who he was in this movie He is a chameleon never the same I never seen him play a bad part yet This was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry I re-winded the scene few times one time because I didnt know who he was His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent I have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff But she is so good here I actually know people who act just like her So it was very real to me Macy Grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good I was very happy that they did not kill Nanny off I thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people There are women like that in most of our lives People we might know or even lived with Thank god for them I do not know how they do it all of the time I have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever I am feeling selfishly sorry for myself I call her and she always puts me in a good mood THis movie is a tribute to all of those people I only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man Paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on HBOs The Wire Omar Rosie Perezs character and Richard the lesbian and Delroy Lindos one arm man he was mesmerizing in another small role
This was a great movie Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child The performances by S Eptath was outstanding Mos Def and his singing was off the hook Had to do a double take when I saw that was Rosie Perez there But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching All the different stories they had was amazing And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence I can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone Cant wait for it to come out on DVD It would be a welcome addition to any movie library
No blood no sex (though it oozes passion) no special effects but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when youre not really looking and grabs your attention br br Great acting great sets great music beautiful storyline If only there were a lot more movies made like this one!br br The sets move us through time and make us feel like we were therebr br The acting appears like real life and elevates us to the level of awareness of Nanny to whom no-one is a lost cause least of all the inhabitants of her own Halfway house br br Best of all its a true story of misfits learning to fit in I was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie! Could we all spend some time in Nannys house?
Lackawanna Bluesis so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s A culture of joy and sadness specific to working class Blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture The characters of Santiago-Hudsons play depicted Black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of loveloyalty and honor Although the characters moved away from those values at times they did not deny the importance of the values Instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters without judgment that passed through the life of nanny The central characters were strong and believable the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a by-gone era Pre-integration urban life was a time of sensory intoxication sight soundand smell that could almost be experienced by watching the drama Lackawanna Blues unfold I will watch it again and again
I gave this film my rare 10 starsbr br When I first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line I almost turned it off I am very glad I didntbr br This is a character driven film a true story which revolves mainly around the life of Rachel Nanny Crosby a strong beautiful (inside and out)Black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of Lackawannabr br Highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of Nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for African Americans in the 1950s prior to integration and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the Black communitybr br In addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast there is some fine singing and dancing from that era
Superb editing outstanding acting especially by Epatha Merkerson and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack This film reaches back to the 40s to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic ladybr br The actor portraying the young Terrence Howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town The audience laughed cried and erupted in applause for the film and its director br br Soon to be shown on HBO (Feb 7 I believe) - fire up the TIVO and enjoy a great story!
I always felt that Ms Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills Familiar to millions as the Lt on Law and Order she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases always in a supporting role HBOs Lackawanna Blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as Nanny successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration But the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna New York a suburb of Buffalobr br The story could be set in any major African-American community of the 50s and 60s from Atlantas Sweet Auburn to New Yorks Harlem But the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at Nannys boarding house The story revolves around Nannys relationships with all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the business (I purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black except for Jimmy Smits of course) I recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day
The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S Ephata Merkerson Ms Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny the woman who believes in doing good no matter to whom with no strings attached This actress clearly shows a range that is amazingbr br Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes placebr br Of course none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadnt written his wonderful play Working with Mr Wolf perhaps the best theater director of this generation they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of Ms Crosby when his own parents are not around to take care of him Ms Crosby becomes the adoring mother of little Ruben; in a way he represents her reward for having lost her own daughterbr br Unfortunately there is no time to develop some of the characters as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between Nanny and the young Ruben played with such charm by the young Marcus Carl Franklin who is a natural The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive as it doesnt clarify or justify what one is seeing Frankly just by watching the interaction of the players is self explanatorybr br In the background there is always music No matter what hard times these people are going through but Nannys house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that erabr br Aside from Ms Merkerson other notable performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard one of the rising stars of the moment Mos Def Jeffrey Wright Marcy Gray Louis Gossett JrDelroy Lindo Rosie Perez Carmen Ejogo Jimmy Smits and the restbr br Ms S Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience In Lackawanna Blues she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma
The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel Nanny Crosby who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy Ruben the narrator of the film Based upon the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s br br The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse Nannys ability to take fragments and make them whole affects everyone within her sphere An especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband telling him firmly If you ever touch that child again were going to dance! As delivered by actress S Epatha Merkerson that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger temper is frozen in his tracks br br From start to finish Merkerson delivers a commanding presence Her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home This was a touching heartfelt film with a wonderful cast As played by Merkerson the character of Nanny simply radiates love This is a film experience that I will remember for a long time to come
Fun entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) falling in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson) while trying to get secrets from him For some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970--I cant see why Its beautifully shot has wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting aerial dogfights Also it has Andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--Whistling in the Dark The movie does have problems Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows Their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry Still they turn in OK performances The film is a little long (even in the 105 min directors cut I saw) and gets way too dark and serious at the end Still worth catching Try seeing the directors cutthe other one runs half an hour longer!
It really is a great film (after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny) Julie is as usual wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket London on its release However Julies non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not Two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years But Darling Lilijust like STAR! deserves much more public appreciation
Darling Lili is a mixture of Perfection and Magic! The Stars; Julie Andrews & Rock Hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried Its full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you The brilliance of the Director; Blake Edwards is shown to be at his best He was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen!br br The blend of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film The Film opened with Julie Andrews singing Whistling Away In The Dark and closed with the same Song by Andrewsbr br For A Film Of This Excellence To Have Been Such A Failure When It Was Released Is A Total Shockbr br As It Is: InspirationalPurelyInspirational! ~One Of Andrews Most Memorable Lines In This Film!
I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Directors Cut version I was very surprised that it was rated G How did they get bedroom scenes a seduction story line two strip tease acts and warshootingblood into a G rating? Weird I would rate it PG-13br br Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie It was a beautiful showcase of Andrews voice and talent The acting was great The storyline was a little weak leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue There were too many no talking just walking scenes for me I would have liked to see the the relationship between Julie and Rock blossom so that the intense love would be more believable
I first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an LP recording of the soundtrack I liked it so well I went back to see it several timescannot understand why it was considered a flop Julie Andrews was lovely in this film her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful!br br The film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy-handed they were still fun br br I recently found I could get a copy in DVD form and ordered itI was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the DVD I ordered
This Blake Edwards film isnt too sure whether it wants to be a comedy a drama or a musical No matter the sheer presence of Julie Andrews is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film Rock Hudson looks tired but hes is more than fine as Julies romantic interest Authentic World War I cars and planes add to the appeal Overall the film is very entertaining The DVD release is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original release Supposedly this is the only version that Edwards would allow; but Turner Classic Movies has shown the complete (theatrical release) version recently Recommended
Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie  musical The opening song by Ms Andrews Whistling Away the Dark will always be in the back roads of my mind The plot line during World War I is great and suspenseful one If you are a romantic you will love this movie This is a movie that I always enjoy to see again and again
i found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful henry mancici music didnt lull me julie andrews was excellant and i sure dont understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes me happy at the end to have everybody singing and i do like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor
This movie is certainly well-constructed beginning and ending in the dark with focus on Lili Smith Schmidt Julie Andrewsinitially the singing angel later the notorious spybr br Its beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently While it was dismissed by critics in the 70s as overblown cinema vulgaris and lacking in structure (among others) time has proven them wrong Blake Edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical qualitybr br The film soars and swirls (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates One must just buy into the premise that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong Overlooking the tepid chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson one must believe that these are lovers - who in all innocence fall for each other And in the end love is far more important than winning wars And so is maintaining innocencebr br There is a lot of understated acting and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comediesbr br There are wonderful comedic elements (foreshadowing the French goons in VictorVictoria) interesting diplomatic asides (reminding me of The Tamarind Seed seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of good-willbr br Suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away Julie Andrews belting out of war songs and the haunting Whistling Away the Dark are reason enough to turn the TV on just for the soundtrack And the striptease number like the Jenny number in Star! works br br This film has like a good champagne aged well Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible The same applies to transferring the laser disk of Star! to DVD These are both interesting pieces of Julie Andrews meticulous and then underrated works
I always loved this film The musicstory and the action I especially love the opening and closing of the film The music stayed with me throughout the years The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical Blake Edwards Slaptick is his forte after all Julies singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen The sets and the scenes are wonderful The characters are appealing I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julies singing to them I wish she sang to me in Vietnam I also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the WWI musicI was glad when the DVD arrived Now I can whistle in the dark watching it again and again
Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this isnt bad! In fact its quite entertaining Actually its a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a stars personaebr br To break Julies goody two shoes mold she plays a German SpyEnglish Musical Hall Actress She subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie SOB and play a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby Blake Edwards directionbr br The movie is admittedly problematic It is hard to feel for her character because shes a German Spy We want to love Julie but shes on the wrong side of the law Probably this is why this movie flopped Julie as a German Spy? Our Mary Poppins? our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German Spy?br br The romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere But never mind its a musical and it has Jullie Oh and did I mention hunky Rock Hudson is in it too?br br Julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss Great WW 1 Songs and nice tunes by Mancinibr br Yes the film has plot holes and at times doesnt seem logical For example why is Julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the Germans when a minute ago she was spying for them br br But on another note who cares? The musical numbers are fun and exciting The costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish The cinematography quite on the markbr br It has the annoying idiot detectives that Blake Edwards puts in all his movies (Yawn)br br But it has Julie- trying desperately to change her image (You can imagine dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: Blake we need to change my image br br Blake: I Will make you a German Spy then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie They wont recognize you It will be the death of Maria Von Trappbr br Fascinating study on changing an image Wonderful Julie A must see for musical comedy buffs Much more entertaining than Star!
Yes I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! Julie Andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the Whistling in the Dark production number The sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that Rock Hudson has been seeing a dancingcall girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you gigglebr br I only wish that this film could be found in video or DVD as I would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!
Darling Lili is fantastic! Its by far one my favorite films! It certainly didnt deserve the poor reviews it received Julie Andrews playing the title role of Lili Smith (Schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie She is entrancing and spectacular! As Julie Andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far I was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is This movie is justgreat (Im running out of adjectives!) its magnificent marvellous amazing funny terribly romantic sad and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews!And to her husband director Blake Edwards Oh yeah Rock Hudson was ok too :)br br Julie Andrews is the beautiful and well-loved singer Lili Smith Rock Hudson portrays Major Larabee who quickly falls for Lili and she with him But their affair was not coincedental There meeting was planned by the German Government (Im not sure if thats exactly what youd call them but you get the point) because the warm happy singing entertainer Lili is actually a German Spy Lili is told to seduce Major LArabee in order to get information of the new Top Secret Opertaion (later know as Crepe Suzette) Though Lili is on a solemn mission she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee) for real making her original quest challenging But Lili pulls through and completes er task after she finds out something that is not really true about Bill The ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out If anything youll thoroughly enjoy this movie I most certainly did!!!!!!!!br br 
This often maligned movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards Julie Andrews Henry Mancini or Hollywood musicals Other writers have commented on the shifts in tone the confusion of plot etc but the film has many things to recommend it The score is one of Henry Mancinis best (and he has written many wonderful ones) several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews Julies performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes (she is at her absolutely loveliest here) the on-location shots are breath-taking and there are some funny Inspector Clouseau-type sight gags to boot Rock Hudson basically phoned in his performance but he is passably good A real curiosity item in that it was the last major film Julie did for about 10 years and in many ways is a precursor to VictorVictoria It is lovely to look at and listen to When will it be available on DVD??? When it is I for one would like both versions--the longer and shorter directors cut Since it was lampooned in SOB they would make a great two-pack!
I suppose I like this film as well as any I know; it is not perfect but under the title The Americanization of Lily this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more and still loved by those who recognized its special Blake Edwards-produced spirit of gentleness clever humor and solid narrative The improbably but delightful story-line follows Lili Smith a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passing as Smith is helping her Uncle who is patriotic too for Germany but neither cruel nor political merely opportunistic Lilis target is William Larrabee a charismatic US squadron leader who can supply her valuable information The plot thickens comes when Lili falls in love with Larrabee has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes She gets jealous of a rival for Larrabees affections then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business The logical end of the film comes when after the terrible WWI has ended as she sings the theme song of the film Wishing in a darkened theater one by one the members of Larrabees squadron appear including her lover himself indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even Uncle Kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of Its a Long To Tipperraree to indicate all is well with the world again This is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of John Goldfarb fame; and it is a delightful narrative Larrabees squadron including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film; and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic both in its scope and realization Credit must go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creations Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for sets Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production design Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score and to Russell Harlan for his shining cinematography In the beautiful footage the principal actors are Julie Andrews as Lili Rock Hudson as Larrabee Keremy Kemp outstanding as Lilis Uncle Kurt Michael Witney Lance Percival as the inebriate pilot gorgeous Gloria Paul as Lilis stripteasing rival and many other fine actors in smaller parts It is hard to say enough nice things about the pace or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by Edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization This comedy also helps prepare the way for Lilis conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing This is a rare sense-of-life film about Lilis Americanization her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen It is haunting I find and beautiful in many ways I consider it to be Blake Edwardsmasterpiece of directing; and under the title The Americanization of Lili I believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard I know
Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson while on an assignment for Germanybr br The songs are beautiful The two are well-paired Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays br br A half-German half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in WW I Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs br br I loved the film Some will say its a chick-flick but so what Its wonderful br br Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped It may not be up to Rocks performance in Pillow Talk Magnificent Obsession or Giantbr br Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland and authentic WW I -type planes were used in the film Scenery for England and France is absolutely gorgeous
Robert McKimsons Acrobatty Bunny is one of the directors finest shorts Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimsons dreadful Big Top Bunny Acrobatty Bunny is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion Acrobatty Bunny is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at Theres a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion In a brilliant Disney parody he hollers Pinocchio down the lions throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come There are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lions cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of Laugh Clown Laugh which as a child I used to impersonate regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name Ive never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but Acrobatty Bunny breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst McKimsons best
Once again Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people This time the traveling circus put a lions cage right over the rabbits hole So Bugs has to come out of the hole and face Nero (thats the name of the lion) which he does in his usual hilarious style After a slow and rocky beginning to the cart it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious Nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for Bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one if still shorn of a classic This animated short can be found on Disk 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3br br My Grade: A-
The good news is that the circus is in town The bad news is thats right over Bugs Bunnys underground home He wakes up as his place shakes like an earthquake hit it when workers pound stakes into the ground and elephants stomp by etcbr br To be more specific the lions cage is place exactly over Bugs hole The lion sniffs food and by process of elimination figures out its a rabbit Bugs curious what all the racket is about winds his way through the tunnel and winds up in the lions mouthbr br Ill say for thing for BB: he is totally fearless at least in this cartoon and at least for 30 seconds When he comes to his senses he runs like crazy and we get a lion-versus-a rabbit battle the rest of the way Once again Bugs faces dumb opponent one he calls Nero but lion is fierce and Bugs will need all his wits and somewhat-fake bravado to fend off this beastbr br About half the gags are stupid and the other half funny but always fast-moving colorful and good enough to recommend I mean its not everyday you can see a lion on a trapeze or doing a hula dance!
A savage undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it At first he thinks Bugs Bunnys home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes Bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground there he meets with Bugs his next trainer br br If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on you should watch this cartoon Director Bob McKimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour br br The signature scenes include:br br 1 the look of Bugs Bunnys home cross-referencing to Donald Duck with the BB name acronym on the headboard of Bugss bed br br 2 Bugs Bunnys short journey with the mine hoist climbing up to the ground floor br br 3 When Nero the Lion calls his friend the Elephant for help Bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the Elephant; since the Elephant needed a broom to outpower that toy mouse he uses Nero as a broom! br br 4 Bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make-up and the practical clown jokes that he makes br br 5 the trapeze scene while Nero chasing after Bugs br br 6 the famous Human Cannonball scene after which Nero the Lion starts dancing Hawaiian Hulabr br The magic moments which keep Acrobatty Bunny fresh at all times in our memory:br br 1 When Bugs comes out of his bunny hole he thinks hes in the Pinocchio tale; and starts acting to save Pinocchio out of the giant whales stomach br br 2 When the Lion roars to scare him Bugs replies back to him with roaringbr br 3 Bugs arguing with the Lion for hes making so much noise then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than him br br 4 Wearing rubber heels at the circus Bugs starts to bounce like toy rabbits and causes Nero to bounce! br br Those are the 10 main reasons that keeps Acrobatty Bunny as a Bugs Bunny classic and can be found in the Bugs Bunny Classics MGMUA Video (1989)
When the circus comes to town and places the lions cage directly over Bugs Bunnys home Bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid Despite the title Acrobatty Bunny its only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics But even leading up to that its quite funny what Bugs does to escape getting eaten; somehow he always manages to use the other characters weakness against him and then pull any convenient object out of thin air! Bugs later ended up in the circus in Big Top Bunny I liked this one better as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know that it was during the Cold War but still) I recommend this onebr br And with the end we can affirm that itll never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon
Channel zapping one night I just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning It tells the sad story of an adopted child Adam whose mother left him after birth The movie takes us through his childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from Adams past I will not reveal more but it is a very in-depth movie and will intrigue you for sure This was one of Jimmy Smits best roles in my opinion
A very good film focusing on a very important issue Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable If more families saw this film perhaps more children would not end up like Adam Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles ever This is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs This is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the United States today There are children struggling with this world wide The really important point here is that it all could have been prevented More people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously It is well done with important messages handled in a graceful way
This was a excellent movie I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching this movie was more than word can explain I also purchased the book and it was great I would like to have a copy for my own use and so I can have my sons teachers watch it alsoI would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where I could purchase it Thank You Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with childrenadults with special abilitys This movie should be shown again on TV The team of doctors that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy His special Ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he can have or that he can borrowbr br Thank You
This movie was everything but boring It deals with reality To the people who think this movie was boring open your eyes to the real problems in our society Our children are dying The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselorand i deal with these problems every day People of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse It destroys families hurts people and leads to serious brain damageall kinds of health problems and death It is all preventable This movie should be shown in every high-school in the world If anyone owns this movie and wants to sell it or sell me a copy please e-mail me at: Ottenbreit2@netzeronet thank you
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV I only wish I could contact someone to see it again I married a man with three children and two had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome I didnt realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties My step-son is now 35 and thank the Lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother We speak every month to Rehab patients with alcohol and drug addictions and this sharing has truly made monumental changes in their behaviors and endeavors to start out a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol Please please let me know how I can get a copy VHS or DVD of this movie or when they will show the movie again on TV If you have not been in these shoes you probably could never understand its value Thank you so very much
This story focuses on the birth defect known as FAS or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome a disease diagnosed too often among Native Americans In spite of the down-beat nature of this drama the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well This is arguably Smits best performance
This is a piece of cinematic beauty and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived breathed and ate everything Maurice Richard The book does this as well as the short and Im glad that in all the time I did spend studying French in high school this was required reading in both languagesbr br I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier narrate this story His molasses-thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story The animation was good as well very surrealist which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream fancying over better days gone bybr br Again as a symbol of culture quebecoise this is unsurpassed One can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove This whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be Canadian and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots Im from Ontario and this film made me fall in love with Quebec Maurice Richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs
I throughly enjoyed this short even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan br br Director Sheldon Cohen and Narrator Roch Carrier captured all of the boys emotions perfectly From the feelings he had for his hero Maurice Rocket Richard to the excitement anticipation and hope of getting a new Montreal Canadiens sweater soon to the look of horror on his face when he got his sweater from his mother; A Toronto Maple Leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful (in his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs sweater; Not the rouge bleu and blanc of the Montreal Canadiens with Richards number nine like his old sweater And worst of all his Mum made him wear this Maple Leafs sweater out of the house You could envision and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got therebr br I was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts Ive seenbr br 
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50s60s and 70s My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986 I have been a Canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life on a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 117 All hockey fans should see this as I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Centre in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place Watch this film with your family it is a great movie I also recommend the book in both French and English Go Habs Go
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec Thats because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades As an American the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees If you are a fan then they are the greatest and winningest team in history If you are not a fan then they are Satans team!! Well at least thats how it was as I grew up in Washington DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys So I am pretty sure when this film was shown up North that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction--their national sport AND the closest thing they have to a national team in the NHLbr br Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for the Canadians AND Maurice the Rocket Richard However when his mother accidentally buys him a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and forces him to wear it I knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy This ability to connect to the character--even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film The way the other kids treated him and his conversation with God at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film Very clever and memorable
A boy who adores Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens receives much to his horror a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the mail I recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey but nearly everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the TorontoMontreal rivalry Highly entertaining amusing and accurate
This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who as a child specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your Mom or Dad (or both) that it didnt matter as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a Witness Protection Program in order to avoid ridicule For those US residents who dont get the horror because you dont follow hockey its like a Dallas Cowboy fan getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey It isnt pretty For our European friends think of two great rival football (soccer to us) clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other Ouch!!! NFB of C outdid themselves here!br br Une hommage du Maurice Rocket Richard merci M Richard
Animated shorts just dont get much better than this wonderful Canadian film This short feature is dripping with Canadian references and so this film will probably be appreciated by Canadians most of all But the basic story is universal and it is told lovingly by writer Roch Carrier It is a hilarious story that I have known for quite sometime and I was recently fortunate enough to see it again so I simply HAD to write a hearty recommendation for it This is a masterpiece and a must-see whether or not you are Canadian
Having been raised in Canada I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC I have seen it numerous times at many ages in my life and each time the reactions are the same It is a joyous bittersweet beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart I am sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere digging aroundbr br Every kid growing up can relate to the situation and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols The scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the Eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless I havent seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short hasbr br Sure I am a Montreal habs fan and that makes my appreciation for it more special But in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey and the memories of your family telling you that you should be greatful for what you get even if it isnt exactly what you wanted And oh yeah the animation is beautiful too ;)br br Rating 10 out of 10
Well I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin on this animated short He loves it and claimed it was hilarious I enjoyed it but didnt see any humor He doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story Living right across the border from Canada I have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in Buffalobut I didnt think much of this cartoon Oh it was interesting and I know what would happen if you wore a Toronto jersey up in the Quebec area - disaster! That especially holds true in the glory years of Les Canadians However that doesnt make the story funny br br Back in the 1950s everyone in the Quebec provinces idolized the Montreal Canadians and their star player Maurice Richard and everyone wanted to be like him When his mother orders a new sweater it has the Toronto Maple Leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it When he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies Whats so funny about that? I could see the same thing happening to a kid in Boston who is Red Sox die-hard and his mom gets him Yankees shirt! Horrors! You couldnt wear it and vice-versabr br Maybe to someone who doesnt follow sports at all like Maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a fact of life or any bit-time sports fan and his favorite team It was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laughbr br The art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid The French Canadian accent was good too This movie was part of the DVD Leonard Maltins Animation Favorites From The National Film Board Of Canada
This short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose undiplomatic criticism extends into his everyday life When he learns why thats not a good idea we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that hes been lecturing on
This movie with all its complexity and subtlety makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I have ever seen The topics it addresses are ugly cynical and at times even macabre but the film remains beautiful in its language artful with its camera angles and gorgeous in its style skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories Tobias Wolffbr br Not wishing to spoil anything of the movie I wont go into any details other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself It takes pride in what it does and does it well It shows the most important memories of life all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling: unexpected bliss This movie of its own volition has created in me the same feelings the main character (Tom Noonan) felt when words transformed his very existence and that is one impressive feat
The finest short Ive ever seen Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened due to the density of insight it offers Theres irony in that comment and little merit The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly I might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect This is a short for people who read for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty A beautiful short film FWIW: I was pleased at the Picasso reference since I once believed that Picasso was just another art whore with little talent; like I assume most people - until the day I saw some drawings he made when he was 12 Picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime I understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for
This is a very very odd filmone that is so odd its best you just see it for yourself The film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance Additionally he seems tired and bored with the monotony of lifebr br Later in the film he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head Oddly this is only half-way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life This is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professors novels--one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say thembr br See this weird film--its amazingly compelling and not like anything Ive ever seen before
Although Bullet In The Brain is without question superior amongst short films it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film And it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot But after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place There is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit - it seems like theres almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast A slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit Despite these complaints there is no denying that Bullet In The Brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short and even full length films The makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and Hollywood action
means take up and read which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous filmbr br Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolffs 1995 New Yorker article of the same name The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing sound design cinematography and directing are truly inspired The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle clever and make the film cinematically more dynamic Its lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it againbr br Watch out for this young directorhes going places
br br Her Excellency Madam Shabana Azmi has worked in countless movies over life time I think best is yet to comebr br Fire is okbr br But still good days are yet to comebr br Hopefully in Water I will be able see her betterbr br Thanks and Regardsbr br PS: India doesnt have a director to make best use of her
For a moment lets put aside the cultural aspects of this movie even if it is a very important side of it and lets look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish husbands They have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope If each one of these two women had been alone imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept They found each other and they fell in love That this love was against all the social religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant They loved each other found relief in each other that was sufficient The reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept suffer even and then they can go on with their lives their life Very nice
As well as being a portrayal of a lesbian love story FIRE is also a comic satire of middle-class (?) Indian culture I find this is a quality which is little appreciated about the movie These two genres (ie deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do but Mehta (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection The servant Jatins behaviour the familys treatment of him the bedridden grandmothers constant inescapable presence Ashoks obsession with a swamis teachings: coming from a culture much like Indias these are things I can immediately identify as being typical They have been crying out to be pointed out and ridiculed While developing her primary subject matter Mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully In fact much of the humour in the film which provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues stem from this satire of the seemingly ordinary The film flows from the comic to the serious with great subteltybr br All in all brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compared to Sita of legend and coming out of Fire unscathed and therefore pure; the lifelong desire of the young Radha to see the ocean finally achieved when she gains freedom) Kudos to Shabana Azmi(Radha) the lighting crew and Deepa Mehta; their very un-Hollywood-like (and un-Bollywood-like!) talents made this movie special One criticism: the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me in that they did not flow into each other very wellbr br The verdict: 9 on 10 Nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned on my mind
Easily one of the best Indian films ever Granted thats not saying much(I made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching) But I can truly say that Fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films Ive seenbr br Beautiful because of its imagery The best example I can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads(Radha and Sita) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology Sita for example is the wife of the revered Lord Ram As legend goes Ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to prove her purity Sita in response cries and leaves him reuniting with her mother(the Earth) This story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 Indian women(Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi) The word Fire all of a sudden has many meanings - marriage tradition religion motherhood and probably a few others I didnt catchbr br Brilliant because of its social overtones Many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see Fire(eg my mom who actually loved it) Why? Because although Fire is an attack on tradition it is also an attack on tradition In other words that is its strength NOT its weakness Traditional conservative social mores(whether Indian or Canadian or American or whatever) are useless if they enslave you Gender roles and self-denial can both do thisbr br These are the things I took with me after seeing Fire Hats off to Deepa Mehta
The movie is really about choices In the oppressed state of affairs as seen in Fire where good women had to be obedient and do what was correct in the eyes of tradition there seemed few options for Radha and Sita However granted that it was not their only option What is life without desire Radha questions Ashok Yes its true that life provides us with a number of options but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors When your world is confined to a small Indian household being a dutiful daughter-in-law to a silent but observant still powerful matriarch a dutiful wife of 13 years to a man who has taken a vow of celibacy due to your not being able to have a child a man who only wants you lying next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires I felt the ladies had little choice but to find solace in each others company I guess the fact that so many women applauded Ms Mehtas work was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves An option to do what was perhaps unacceptable The lesbian scenes I felt was merely to put that point across Every scene in the movie from the first at the Taj Mahal to the last at the Mosque is etched in my mind How frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires To feel that you had to forgo the human touch to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you To have to suppress any desire you might have and to crave for the human touch What then is the meaning of our existence one wonders In the scene where Sita is crying alone in the room and Radha comes in to comfort her their lips accidentally brush against each others and it awakens a feeling in them Something they have both been deprived ofbr br Bravo to Ms Mehta in translating her vision so clearly I especially like the flashbacks to the young Radha trying to see for the ocean It is a metaphor for freedom Freedom to choose freedom to transport ourselves to places we would normally be unable to reach In those scenes it is gently told to us that her sense of duty has also been passed down from her mother who I assume lives within the rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage The movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by AR Rahman Since the film I have become ardent fans of the two lead actresses and the director I look forward to more of Ms Deepas future productions
The theme is controversial and the depiction of the hypocritical and sexually starved india is excellentNothing more to this filmThere is a lack of good dialogues(why was the movie in english??) There was lack of continuity and lack of passionemotion in the acting
Deepa Mehtas Fire is groundbreaking bold and artistic A masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative upper middle class Indian households this is a film no one should miss Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible AR Rahmans music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film Mehta uses Rahmans score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they look to each other for support This film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it Lesbianism is just a part of the film It is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning
For all that has been said about the subject matter and the controversy that surrounded it please do not overlook what I feel to be the most important part of the film: the salient struggles of everyone to keep their pride through their trials Whether dealing with self-imposed male braggadocio a sexual reawakening or even life itself everybody is human
Water (2005) the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehtas elemental trilogy has been finally completed almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element Fire (1996) which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel 1947: Earth (1998) Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch (1975) but it was her Canadian feature film about the life of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back in east her country by birthright Sam & Me (1991) Recognition internationally came in the way of Camilla (1994) starring Bridget Fonda along with the actress who in 1990 won an Oscar in Best Actress in a Leading Role category at the age of 80 paving the way for middle-aged actresses to still have hope for her portrayal of a stubborn old Jewish woman in Driving Miss Daisy (1989) late Jessica Tandy br br Camilla dealt with a friendship between two women from two other ends of the human lifespan a MayDecember friendship Camilla was Tandys last picture; she died the very same yearbr br International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial Fire which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist Having already explored friendship between two women in Camilla in Fire Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women Set in modern day India the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi it shows two brothers and their wives the elder brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy faithful to his guru of sexless existence The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) is having an extra marital affair with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon) Thus both the wives Shabana Azmi playing the elder brothers wife and Nandita Das the younger wife find themselves neglected in their own way One forced to lead a celibate life thanks to her husbands eccentricities and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex and nothing more Living in a world of in-laws and being the only two outsiders in the family having nobody else to confide in the two women fall in the arms of each other Thus comes the issue of lesbianism If there were an outside mans shoulder to cry on there most probably would have been chance for them to fall into the arms of a man but having no one else to confide in their need for each others support is quite obvious It does not necessarily state that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism it just happened to exist with regard to the two women in this context All in all the movie is excellent and delves far deeper than just two women rolling in bed The key focus isnt lesbianism in the movie but the plight of modern day neglected Indian wives even in the capital city the two female characters just happen to have a sexual relationship br br Two years later Deepa Mehtas second installment was the element of mother earth released in India by the name of 1947: Earthyet another excellent movie by a great director this time in the Hindi language unlike Fire which was made in the English language br br Now Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy despite a lot of problems having released the final installment recently Water No doubt it would be just as great as the other two
This was a bold movie to hit Indian cinemas when it was released The first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst Indian women The leading actress of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with Nandita Dasbr br The movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible The sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemasbr br Good acting by all the actors especially Nandita Das amidst criticism from the Indian public
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece Id recommend to buy this movie on DVD because its a movie you might want to watch more often than just once And trust me youd still find little meaningful details after watching it several timesbr br The characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced no black and white Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists there is also empathy for the other charactersbr br I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants dont belong or arent accepted they dont need to conform and dam their desires The other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness It fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires The mother in her still couldnt find the strength to destroy his myth She sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust-control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up? Both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband br br But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept Sitas desire A decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culturebr br Seems like it was easiest for the househelp to let his desires flow - since hes anyway damned by his culture - being at the bottom of the hierarchy Since there is anyway no respect and expectations might as well taste sin
It is more a subtle story of the fact that in Indian household how most decisions are taken by the man how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires not to give the woman pleasure And in such a type of scenario women invariably have two choices either to accept all this and take it into their own life which is usually the case or not accept this and try to mould things to satisfy themselves which makes a movie!br br Fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option which women choose for themselves no sacrifice not to serve anybody else rather a decision for their own good Somehow the whole idea of justifying lesbianism didnt find an acceptance in the Indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self-expression then the whole debate doesnt even arise
While the romance in this film is an important aspect it is largely about the role of responsibility and duty in modern Indian All of the major characters were well fleshed out and had their own inner life I recommend this strongly
one of best movies everFireit is not much about sociological description of India todayit is the mind blowing use of light that never stops never becomesnormaleven whenin this sense the movie is almost uniqueboth leads are of very good qualitythe origin of Das as a street performer are pretty obviousher performance is a superb cammeobut the use of the lightI have look at it and looked at it again and againstill mind blowing after agesnothing torrid in the storyrather pure way of facing the subjectin a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today a major art work is usually known as a gender filmFire can stand face to face with Dryers Jeanne D Arc or Ichikawas Biruma no Tategoto or some of the major Kurosawa movies just to name some Wish my input could help a little this movie to its deserved way to fame
I finally watched the third film in Mehtas trilogy: Fire To begin Id say that Water was the unquestionable masterpiece on all levels Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality Fire: there is so much going on in this film that Ill need a few more viewings to drink it all in The writing is superb the script creating friction that starts the entire process of heat from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships br br Mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced false and repressive about the great society from which she came from India is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change That she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of Water after having had the script cleared shows that there are still many taboo subjects which Indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face cannot examine or discuss them Worse if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues she faces death threats So as much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic tolerant society the facts are not always so Whereas Earth was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after Indian independence Fire and Water are pointing at personal social and religious issues which as I say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that an open artistic dialog is still many years away As I write this Water is scheduled to actually be shown in India later this year Ill believe it when I see it br br Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that I saw in A price above rubies Whether its arranged marriages (which it used to be like among Jews about 150 years ago or like it is among many modern Indians) they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women; or just plain loveless marriages However this is not the real issue Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire) I am no expert regarding either the secular or Hindu laws concerning divorce The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce)is almost as bad as the sad marriage In any case Mehtas film is a very moving powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny That all three of these films have made themselves felt in India as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset Mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack I admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough Superb disturbing provocative taboo shattering
There are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer Two women progressively find themselves ensnared in each others arms (as corny as the expression sounds that is exactly what happens) and fins that they cannot answer their own question as to what defines their relationship when their very own society has no name to what they are Deepa Mehtas somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy here linked by the theme of the elements and more symbolic than consuming Fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not make an appearance here since the women -- the older and more feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and the younger more masculine tempered Sita (Nandita Das) come to realize they share a lot more than common ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families As in WATER FIRE is deeply spiritual even if it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama (where WATER much like the weight of the word carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition) Even so its a very beautiful picture and a strong voice from a strong director
Now I do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all Indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians have concerning their women and sexuality I have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society (with women being murdered because the husbands family doesnt want them any more after his death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing) I also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter--even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in India a decade ago As a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie most Western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this filmbr br Although I am a male am not rabidly feminist and I am straight the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is NOT an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by Lesbians and man haters In fact I dont think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands Yes I use the word wicked and mean it as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouses sexuality In many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existencebr br One husband married a vivacious young woman Sita out of family obligation This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning Sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband However he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about Sita--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady To make matters worse he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies In their dead marriage sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way Sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met And unfortunately he could have cared lessbr br Another husband was married to a lady who was infertile (Radha) Oddly after initially trying to have children they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever! Its because this man has decided to become an ascetic (ie in Hinduism a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment) Now his wanting to do this was all well and good IF he was not already married and had obligations for his wife However being married this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care The closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him--as having her next to him helped teach himself to overcome the desires of the flesh This must have brought nothing but frustration to herbr br So youve got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs Eventually these needs bring these sister-in-laws together--at first just emotionally but later sexually as well The movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolationbr br Late in the film when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from Radhas enlightened husband--a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossiblebr br This is a very challenging and adult film While there is very little nudity the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids Very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady--as I said this is NOT a film to let your kids watch However for a mature audience this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to thinkbr br The film features good acting complex characters excellent writing lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some but which I found rewarding The only serious negative I cannot blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape This is because although the movie is in English the accents are quite strong at times and its not always easy to understand whats being said BUT and this is the worst part there are no closed or open captions--including them is a must for Western audiences If you do watch this film see if you can find it on DVD or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning--mine sure didntbr br By the way director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOODHollywood A consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and Westernism--with a strong emphasis on female characters Not surprisingly this West-thinking lady makes her home in Canada and is divorced--a truly unusual woman to say the least For a similar film that explores traditional culture meets Western culture try another Canadian gem EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN
Overall a well done movie There were the parts that made me wince and there were the parts that I threw my hands up at but I came away with something more than I gone in withbr br I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition Without spoiling it let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in Ramayana is way beyond what this movie stands for The Ramayana is an epic Not a 200 page book that puts down women in India The movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive Indian family While the basic tenets of the unwritten laws of the family tradition seem to be that of conservative India let me assure my reader that I (having lived in Delhi for 12 years) found entire parts that just did not ring those bells I mean some things and some actions are very true but some other stuff is just way off the mark Especially todaybr br Delhi is complicated India is complicated The director tries to simplify both And fails pretty miserably at thatbr br Why in English? Can you imagine a movie about American Indians in English Or the French speaking in English Seriously jarring Even the servant spoke in fluent accented English (albeit with a hint of colloquialisms in the language for believability)br br But the chemistry between the leads is palpable If you like it hot this is a movie for you I think that is the biggest saving grace - the development of a true real life love storybr br If this film was about Radha and Sita then it would have got full marks from me And in being about them it could have made a subtle statement But this movie goes out there to say this is what India is and this is what Indian society is like And in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt The dark secrets of India are not being revealed Just two girls are falling in love Just like it happens everywhere else
A stunningly well-made film with exceptional acting directing writing and photographybr br A newlywed finds married life not what she expected and starts to question her duty to herself versus her duty to society Together with her sister -in-law she makes some radical departures from conventional roles and mores
This was a great film in every sense of the word It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others the importance of status and face religious hypocrisy sexism the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity the binding concepts of duty and so on At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves The film is well-acted and genuine completely believable from beginning to end unlike most Bollywood flicks The main faults of the film as I saw it was first that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead-end marriages with no passion and no rewards This may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters but most people stuck in the same situation will not turn homosexual It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual -- when Radha does her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok she makes it quite clear that without desire she was dead and the implication was that if he had desired so he could have fulfilled her quite completely and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals -- they may seek comfort in others in the same position but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning -- quite the opposite Some people are bisexual it is true but most tend to be either hetero- or homosexual In the case of the ladies in the film both had insensitive jerks for husbands    if this had not been the case would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered? The film ignores this The other fault is the naming of the characters    the names Sita and Radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage (imagine a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named Jesus and another named Paul!) by using names associated with various Hindoo scriptures The film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion At any rate the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie It is indeed a very touching and powerful story -- the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre
This is my first Deepa Mehta film I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its Sita character presented as Nita I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not NitaSita Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta not her direction The characters big and small were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of Mazurskys An Unmarried Woman They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men And one cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him---carrying his invalid mother Biji He seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion br br Ms Mehta seems to fumble as a director (however compared to most Indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant) as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social milieu of India She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!) Yet her Radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field Compare her to Mrinal Sen Adoor Gopalakrishnan Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giants--given her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehtas film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space Kannada Malayalam and Bengali films have touched parallel themes in India but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoersbr br Ms Das Ms Azmi Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors (Mrinal Sens Khandar Gautam Ghoses Paar Benegals Ankur) a brilliance notably absent in this film Ms Das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability All in all the films strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema I am sure Ms Mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays
CONTAINS SPOILER INFORMATION Watch this directors other film Earth at some point Its a better film but this one isnt bad just differentbr br A rare feminist point of view from an Indian filmmaker Tradition rituals duty secrets and the portrayal of strict sex roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic film viewing experience All of the married characters lack the fire of the marriage bed with their respective spouses One husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual adultery by giving all of his love honor time and respect to his religious swami (guru) His wife is lonely and yearns for intimacy and tenderness which she eventually finds with her closeted lesbian sister-in-law who comes to live in their house with her unfaithful husband This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese mistress but was forced into marriage with a (unbeknownest to him) lesbian They only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginitybr br A servant lives in the house and he eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers Another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke However she uses a ringing bell to communicate her needs as well as her displeasure with the family members She lets them know through her bell or by pounding her fist that she knows exacly whats going on in the house and how much she disapprovesbr br In the end the truth about everybody comes out and the two female lovers end up running away together But not before there is an emotional scene between the swami-addicted husband and his formerly straight wife Her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die However we see the two women united in the very last scene of the moviebr br The writerdirector of this film challenges her cultures traditions but she shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture and gender We come to really care about the characters and we dont see them as stereotypes Each on surprises us with their humanity vulgarity tenderness anger and spirit
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the films plot details than I could What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense - emotionally visually editorially - just gorgeousbr br If you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of artbr br On a scale of 1 to 10 Id give it about an 875 The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece If you are in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then its a 10 I definitely think its a must-see but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall 875
Its worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film Three main female deities -- wise Sita nurturing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave Rama playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender -- are all alluded to Knowing the folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story In fact one folktale is enacted first on stage as part of a lesson in spirituality and then in the movies real life Fire speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewers awareness making it a deeply satisfying presentation This is the finest film ive seen in the past ten years; very highly recommended!
This intelligent moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkners novels)br br The characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume and seek for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them off altogether But as the story develops the two wives trapped in loveless marriages draw together Drawing on the strength of their friendship and love they give each other the courage to abandon their rolesbr br They have found that living within their traditions is no life at all it is a sort of living death: without passion without true connection to others without fulfillment Although they know there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom it is a price much less dear than the sacrifice called for by a comfortable predictable existencebr br The screenplay is wonderful the acting marvelous Near perfect!
The thing which makes Fire even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry is its touch of femininism and rebellion To my mind the very character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society The name of the movie and the scene when Radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of Hindu Mythologys Lord Ramas wife Sitas walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy as per the same narrative which appears in the film too The film could be a great inspiration for women particularly those in the subcontinent to search for their liberties and to attain control of their lives
A fairly interesting look at some characters from Indias burgeoning middle class Although India is rapidly modernizing her culture is not keeping up This film involves the patriarchal society where women are not yet truly free citizens A land of arranged marriages men who dally with mistresses with total impunity and women who are expected to tolerate all this will eventually come up short I was impressed with Nandita Das who was quite attractive and played her character with total earnestness But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood Her quiet beauty and low-key psychic suffering was excellent The lesbian subtext of this film was never particularly erotic and never titillating (Darn!) Worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures
This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition All this against a backdrop of an India which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values This film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front It is easy to see why Fire has caused riots in India but tragic nonetheless A true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world not just privileged westerners
SPOILER ALERT! Dont read on unless youre prepared for some spoilersbr br I think this film had a lot beneath its shell Besides the apparent connections with Oldboy (and Park-wooks other films) an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric physical actionbr br The main actor Kang-ho Song is terrific in the rôle of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally sang means blood in some languages - who truly loved Tae-ju played by OK-bin Kim Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in Badlands where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her fingerbr br Their relationship is one thing but the girls mother is entirely different While moving she is stiff one-dimensional and taut but paralysed she says all through not moving or through the wink of an eyebr br Park-wook has really really mastered his cinematography in this film and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catchbr br The music is quite stock using mostly strings to accompany the main thespians monoreaction; its a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is While he does very little and loses at that he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot While his love-interest says and does a lot her actions display very little thought behind it In my humble opinionbr br All in all a very disturbing film that is not made for action which isnt even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days; its magnificent and repellant at the same time
(This has been edited for space)br br Chan-wook Parks new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify Nominally a horror movie the central character is a vampire the film actually has elements of comedy theology melodrama cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body) romance and few other things as well Its a film that has almost too much on its mind The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature in this case Emile Zolas Thérèse Raquin Its an odd mix that doesnt always gel but none the less has an incredible power Here it is almost 24 hours since I saw the film at Lincoln Center (with a post film discussion by the director) and I find my cage is increasingly rattled Its not so much what happens is bothersome its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospectbr br The plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood (its not explained) he actually survives Hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick Unfortunately all is not well The priest finds that he needs blood to survive He also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire and its no not possible for him to go out during the day Things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family The priest some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend From there it all goes sidewaysbr br An ever changing film this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was Its a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else Its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of waysbr br The film has enough going on that one could and people probably will write books discussing the filmbr br The two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance The vampire part of the tale is brilliant There is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the affliction that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside Sitting in the theater last night I found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked I think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life Its contrasted with what happens later it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isnt going to work Its not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys rather its something else I personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible (The sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool) The romance is also wonderfully handled Sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done but its the other stuff the looks the talk the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special I love the looks the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected and the mad passion of possible consummation This is one of the great screen romances of all time It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love (and lust) If youve ever loved deeply Im guessing youll find some part of your hear on screen I know I did The statement I just wanted to spend eternity with you has a sad poignancy to it Its both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion The tragic romance will break your heart br br I wont lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great Its not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great (especially the actors who I have unjustly failed to hail as amazing) the whole doesnt always come together The various genres thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other Frequently I was wondering where the film was going I hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlesslybr br I liked the film a great deal I loved the pieces more than the film as a whole Its been pinging around in my head since I saw it and Im guessing that it will do so for several days more Like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward One of the meatiest and most filling films of the year
The cinematography is the films shining feature Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera Every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen Every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own I hope theres a Blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic Its rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology Park used for his vision Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight He doesnt however have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirrorbr br Although Ive never seen the film I couldnt help but feel like this was Chan-wook Parks version of Twilight The entire middle portion of the film is devoted to Sang-hyeons and Tae-Joos love for one another It felt like the adult version of Twilight really Theres a lot of blood nudity sex and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure Maybe its the Chan-Wook Park fanboy in me but I honestly feel like I can guarantee that this is the better film of the two The psychological aspect that I love about Parks previous films is in Thirst as well Thats a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite The soundtracks to Parks films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove Thirst is no exception While the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlesslybr br The middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film Its weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and its hard to imagine Thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut Nevertheless it is my one nitpick of the filmbr br Chan-wook Park bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark psychological twist on it Parks films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: great writing beautiful cinematography a solid cast some sort of psychological twist thatll mess with your head and a memorable ending Thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on DVD (and eventually Blu-ray hopefully)
I wasnt expecting much because of the harsh reviews and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result Softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films in my opinion allowed the narrative to take the focus Though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace I felt like many of the other things were not For example:br br how his powers were often revealed through interaction with herbr br the very strong and well acted love scenesbr br the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even morebr br Their strong differences of what it means to be vampire created by their prior life experiencesbr br the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the moviebr br Ive heard and read several things about tricks used in other films Of course However i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I feel that he does this well I dont need a director to use new tricks I prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately which i feel is the case with this film br br I recommend it
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique brilliant and very twisted at a minimum Well anything that isnt Im a Cyborg at least Parks newest film titled Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama  yes that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin Park creates a uniquely Korean and uniquely Park vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop Park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like Oldboy or even that of Lady Vengeance Heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience Thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room It crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of Park Chan-wook filmbr br Check out the rest of our review at wwwthefilmstagecom
Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully shot Thirst - laughter Although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didnt know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals br br It helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful and that I was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she becamebr br I read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong I didnt think so In fact the last scenes moving and hilarious (I mean the brown shoes) by turns were among the best in the film
They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughtsbr br That was not the case when I watched Bakjwi under the American title Thirst Now playing at select theaters near you Seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details There WILL be blood in this film and you WILL try to look awaybr br For rest of review please visit http:without-terebiblogspotcom200908thirst-aka-bakjwihtml Thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above
The definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living Bakjwi nearly nails this concept on the head minus the cliché of pointy fangs and neck biting Being an R rated movie I knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires Which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to Twilight Having viewed Chan-wook Parks preceding Oldboy I had very high expectations of Bakjwibr br I anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our anti-hero known as Priest Sang-hyeon and was very impressed by his performance as a holy-man who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying his thirst as a vampire (SPOILER) After the initial premise of him surviving the defective blood transfusion he starts to crave blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability The screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition He starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons The oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative Tae-joo is very riveting as they are played by The Hosts Kanh-ho Song and actress OK-vin Kim The special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesnt offer anything new in the ways of stunts and CGI it didnt impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise The story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own Korean style br br There arent many negatives I can say about Bakjwi Sometimes I ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long The movie was long to begin with On the same token vampires really dont have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with As mentioned before this movie is very tragic so dont expect anything hopeful while watching this br br Overall Bakjwi is delightfully dark morbid and original I strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of Twilight This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish Let The Right One In which is also a good movie
i hate vampire movies with that said this one was very interesting to me i do want to point out one thing tho bakjwi literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories you see count Dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva We also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many categorizes them to be exceptional As I watched the film I realized that the theme of bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to make the bat-vampire connectionbr br Duality of human nature = if you ever read aesops fables there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just cant seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage Mammals and birds find out what this bat has been doing and banish the bat out of their lands at the end of the storybr br the two contradicting sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex sang-hyuns blind priest friend sang-hyuns effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire tae-ju playing both sides her ordinary boring life vs her thrill seeking vampire adventure etc (wont ruin too much u have to watch the film) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance sex violence religion dark-comedytragedy vengeance you name it!br br i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long but this film is very fresh and new something that i havent seen b4 yet I wouldnt say this is CW Parks best work but it is mos def the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing!
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do If you havent seen Oldboy(or the sympathy trilogy for that matter) you are missing out on some of the best films made this century But im not here to talk about them Im here to talk about thirstbr br This movie is not what you would expect Yes it is a vampire movie but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl I wont get into the synopsis(you can read that above) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception With some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting he sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene The movie does start a bit slow but I felt this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters Once things start moving along it almost never lets up until the credits roll Thirst is predominantly a love story but not in the same sense that you would think the relationship between the lead characters is very intense but at the same time almost disturbing Chan-wook Park is no stranger to controversy as we know and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy The end scene is by far the most powerful in the movie and perhaps one of the best conclusions to a film I have seenbr br Overall this is an exceptional film that I feel all movie buffs should see It is an exciting(and admittedly different) take on the world of vampires and the romance is far from sappy or boring This movie is gritty selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways Obviously it is not for everyone but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested See it Do not hesitate
Im the first to recognize that Chan-wook Parks Thirst is exceptionally well made but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time Sang-hyeon(Kang-ho Song)is a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously Instead of legitimately dying Hyeon becomes a vampire always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(bumpssores and the body vomits blood) Sunlight as is known in the vampire genre causes torturous death if exposed to Hyeon for a length of time Hyeon falls in lust with Tae-joo the wife of sickly childhood friend Kang-woo(Ha-kyun Shin) Tae-joo was taken in by Mrs Ra(Hae-sook Kim) regarded as a puppy and practically used as a domestic animal to be ordered around Ta-joo is miserable in this situation and begins a torrid affair she instigates with Hyeon soon manipulating him into perhaps killing Kang-woo by having him believe shes a victim of abuse Renouncing his priesthood Hyeon dives headlong into the relationship with Tae-joo soon a willing participant in killing Kang-woo This incident which Tae-woo contributed to(using a boat in the middle of a lake both proceeded to burying him underwater Tae-woo keeping him Kang-woo from re-surfacing as he attempted to re-enter)will haunt both as circumstances arise with Kang-woo missing(Hyeon got rid of him where police would not find his corpse) Soon Mrs Ra suffers a stroke(though one finger and the ability to blink her eyes contribute mightily as the story progresses showing that she more aware than they are led to believe) and Hyeon gives Tae-joo a special birthday giftvampirism In doing so Hyeon has created a monster Tae-joo admits(though a slip of the tongue)that in fact Kang-woo never hurt her and as she thirsts for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesnt bother her morally or psychologically Tae-joo becomes such a hand full Hyeon has to take desperate measures if he is to stop such a menace to society himself includedbr br I will say that Thirst is one of the best horror films Ive seen regarding 2009 Its a methodical approach Park takes and we are led down a dark road with Hyeon and Tae-joo as they commit terrible deeds with nothing positive ever to come from their unholy union Innocent people die because of Hyeons love(what once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the end)for Tae-joo and it will cease to end if he doesnt make a painful choice We see inside their heads their souls and it isnt always pretty 2 hours with them can be quite exhaustingbut credit to the director for pulling no punches in regards to devious behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people Hyeon seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening accepts hell for Tae-joo so one could look at Thirst as a unique love story but not exactly a healthy onebr br In regards to the violence while Park does have a tendency to pull away from extremely graphic details theres enough sadism involved to perhaps turn the stomach a bit At the very least the way the violence is carried out may be certain to leave a lasting impact The sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be pretty heated and erotic while also sordid and morally reprehensible The movie I think is still quite a complex examination of the lengths one will go to remain attached to an object of affection(lust)
The Priest into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?) http:plazarakutencojpconfuocodiary200911290000br br And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire She did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost but decided to leave human alone Fragile but lovely Femme fatale! This movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire that far beyond priest and salvation Also I thought about love Adam was not so responsible for Eves but this Adam(priest) sacrificial and responsible to pick Eve up from the Paradise Lost vampires world Another Symphonic Poem of Adam & Eve Paradise Lost
Theres this whole theory of horror that some people adhere closely to that the monsters and the violence should be kept off-screen Park Chan-Wook throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety from a stylistic perspective Park seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across Whether its long involved ensemble scenes with the camera whizzing around a mah-jong table or entire weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes dialog from the scenes before and after bleeding over them Park doesnt keep to a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the entire story of a couples relationship from virginal remove through utter codependence to utter self-annihilation--and uses vampirism as the link and priestliness as the drama Its that simple and that complex at the same timebr br You gotta give him credit Too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to Twilight with Twilight almost always being the lesser of the works but here the stories are actually comparable but this one is more raw and honest None of this sparkly coming in the window during the night to talk crap but anything ranging from the dirtiest most desperate and virginal sex scene to eventual spousal abuse as the two leads begin to vie for power over one another Its the same deal--guy and girl meet girl finds out guy is a vampire decides to join him anyway but with no happily ever after just straight-up limited time as they become forced to keep each other closer and closer and run out of options The girls motivations are particularly interesting as one desperately craving power and attention to a fault foiled by the guy who just wants to live a good life as best he can under the circumstances but is a hypocrite who cannot admit that hes merely using his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral trainingbr br The movie isnt perfect and it does tend to stretch (theres no three act five act or any act structure here just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance) but whats great about it is that Park Chan-Wook is willing to show everything frankly and honestly while delighting the horror sensibilities of tension and gore He also provides an expertly chosen soundtrack to hit the emotional high-notes in a pretty effective way toobr br --PolarisDiB

Of the Korean movies Ive seen only three had really stuck with me The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters The second and third - and now fourth too - have all been Park Chan Wooks movies namely Oldboy Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) and now Thirst br br Park kinda reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with his irreverence towards convention All his movies are shocking but not in a gratuitous sense Its more like he shows us what we dont expect to see - typically situations that go radically against societys morals like incest or a libidinous blood-sucking yet devout priest Hes also quite artistically-inclined with regards to cinematography and his movies are among the more gorgeous that Ive seenbr br Thirst is all that - being about said priest and the repressed conscience-less woman he falls for - and more Its horror drama and even comedy as Park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations As such this might be his best work for me yet since his other two movies that Ive seen were lacking the humor element that wouldve made them more palatable for repeat viewings
Oldboy director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie historybr br Trusting the latest Hollywood fad vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent asexual love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past well at least in the second halfbr br Thirst starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story The vampire transformation of a priest is over quite some time sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story which makes for some awkward viewing But the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory Well maybe not so surprisingly if you know Oldboy and Im a Cyborg but thats OK but I guess its fair to say that Thirst beats Parks earlier films in terms of in-your-face violence br br All in all be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some Thirst is original entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than Park Chun-wooks earlier endeavors
Chan-wook Park you have to hand it to the guy In my eyes hes not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfyingbr br Thirst is essentially a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the rules of the subgenre Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure dies and comes back All thanks to the blood he was transfused with Being the only one out of five hundred to survive he becomes quite the celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal Normal however now involves being able to leap great distances without injury wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when rays of sun get on his skin Its not long before hes living with a rather dysfunctional family unit who knew him in his childhood and while he hides his new strange lifestyle he finds himself drawn into a complex love triangle becoming more acceptable of darker thoughts and sliding down a slippery slope that could lead him from man to beast to monsterbr br Deftly blending a number of genres Parks movie felt much fresher and more original to me than Let The Right One In (to use a recent example) and genuinely impressed me with its approach to material that could easily have felt as well-worn and rehashed as any number of other vampire movies weve seen over the years Its a mixture of horror melodrama and comedy while also pondering ideas such as strength of faith the power over life and death the downside of immortality etc etcbr br Some people have complained that this genre-blending approach weakens the movie but I personally found that it was a lively entertaining and always enjoyable movie helped by a great central performance from Song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast with no weak links Many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability especially the young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the object of the priests love lust and affectionbr br Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular) and also fans of Poes The Tell-tale Heart (watch and learn) should lap this up its yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainmentbr br See this if you like: Cronos Near Dark Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man
The great thing about Thirst Chanwook Parks latest film is that its the anti-Twilight Some of you may take that as a minus but in reality its a big plus Park takes the method of vampirism seriously and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that unbeknownst to him turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire and Tae-Joo with her mother and idiot brother the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama Theres nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point and the implications put forth from religion early on (Sang for example is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism even as he just cant be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil push it up into another plane cinematicallybr br That Thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that Park has displayed with Oldboy Lady Vengeance and the underrated Im a Cyborg but Thats OK should be taken as a given Thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric part romanticerotic part dramatic and lastly fantastical And it doesnt always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set-up (though as a horror movie Park has more than his share of scary scenes) Its more akin to the movie Near Dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention and that the disease itself and its effect on a persons existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed Once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds youve seen em allbr br Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor much like Oldboy only here with a bite (pun intended) meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being An example of this can be found with the Priests predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor Or the manner in which Tae-Joo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive even as shes had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood-suckers whove brought pain and horror to her home But these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience What makes Thirst last in the mind is how elements come together of drama and existential pains of a Bunuelian-surreal sense of Catholicism (I especially loved the dynamic between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood-sucking but really wants to be a vampire too) and of the erotic: the scenes where the priest finally gives in to Tae-Joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets Not in a pornographic manner but in the sense of these characters release and escape which doesnt last long over the scope of the storybr br If its not as great as Oldboy its not something to carp about Not all films Chanwook Park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and at the least hell always be known as the man who directed that movie) But Thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general The film-making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous (and what a white room of daylight the characters live in!) the humor is dark and hilarious the acting is intense and moody- especially from subtle strokes from Song Kang-ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from Kim OK-vin and the ending when it does finally get there is one of those truly superb vampire-movie endings youll be talking about for years in a good way In a battle between Thirst and Twilight Thirst takes the knock-out in the first round Between Let the Right One In or Near Dark its tougher to call 9510
Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire Add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipebr br Directed in part in a style similar to the Sympathy trilogy its as sumptuous as it is dark Steering clear of cliché it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre Its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust However the film doesnt take itself too seriously and there is boundless humour throughoutbr br Our leads play their roles to perfection playing with our emotions and revelling in the dark humour There are moments of reflection on the whole moral conundrums involved in the film but its never preachy Some might find it overlong and it can lull at points but its worth giving it a chance to the endbr br If you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late Dark and engrossing it will pull in a crowd One Id recommend you give a try
After watching Oldboy I was a little disappointed by the rest of Parks work some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that Oldboy had This one does it is nothing like Oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is therebr br The acting is good with Kang-ho Song OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin delivering excellent performances Kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstepbr br The plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clichésbr br The directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen It does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever seebr br This is just a great film
Now that I have seen it it was NOT what I was expecting at least not until the very END I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did Having been first introduced to Parks work via Oldboy I was curious to how hed treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while Oldboy and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vamp movies For example the scene where Father Hyeon is realizing the beast growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and he is able to SEE the blood pumping through Tae-jus skin and his eyes widen in blood-lust for it That was a nice effect I was also happy that Park did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all I came away from Bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true Park fashion Additionally I liked that Park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we dont usually get this is Asia cinema During the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring Park treats you a little like Ghost of Christmas future coming to show you albeit a bit boringly what life is like outside your world Ah but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen Father and his burgeoning lust for Tae-ju and conflict with duty as a priest We almost start to root for them even until Park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong It wont spoil it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and I think youll come away from it with what Park wants you to come away with Dont expect Oldboy and stylization because thats not what youll get here A very interesting take on the genre indeed Those who missed the MANY literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie not Bakjwi After Bakjwi watch Let The Right One IN its also not what youll expect either
No pun intended Im not going to spoil anything about the story but its safe to assume that you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays And of course being a priest while being naughty exaggerates all that Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yetbr br If you have seen Wooks previous worksmovies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here While it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface it still has quite some heat hidden underneath And when that boils quite a few bad things start to happen But through all that dark there also moments of light (fun) to be had too A very stylistic and though provoking movie that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job 
The vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization There were many sub-genre films last year from a multitude of countries Ive reviewed many and have a few more to discuss Forgive my indulgence but since Ive recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple) Im going to now move outside of North America for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didnt see as of nowbr br Of the many effects of Twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies I hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides I think men are prone to hate Stephenie Meyers work (and its offspring) to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated Women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times We need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying (unequally) if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant Cue: Thirst This Korean film was directed by Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame There are two ways to dissect it Either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one Dont let me convince you that the film has no inclinations Its director is a man whose fame is story-driven action films Its protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on this later) Still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned There is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so one-sided that women could not enjoy it The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moonbr br The plot follows an Emile Zola novel called Thérèse Raquin which I have not read According to Wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man He kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her The two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead mans body between them They are thus driven to insanity but care for the womans ailing mother At the novels conclusion they try to kill each other discover each others plans and commit suicidebr br Now transcribe this nearly 150 year old French novel into modern South Korea and youve got Thirst Chan-Wook doesnt embellish the story enough to elevate this to must-see He often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration I think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative His use of the mother-in-law as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect See itbr br The protagonist is originally a devout Christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine He thus becomes the god he once was smitten with People flock to him and view him as a grand healer OK Thats really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship Yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic Christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it Instead of confronting the delusional people he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patientsbr br Lets continue with the Christian allusion The woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughter-in-laws treachery (finger waggles) The man kills her but resurrects her The two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans The man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him They both die but he atones for her crimes (and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominently)br br The woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior She is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive Vampirism magnifies their characteristics She becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge He becomes a demigod with a spirit His life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention
From the director of Oldboy comes this slick vampire flick Kang-ho Song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly mysterious virus His vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict but he is able to survive by robbing the hospitals blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some siphoned blood Because of his supposedly miraculous survival he comes into the lives of Ha-kyun Shins family Shin has cancer and his mother believes that Song can cure it Unfortunately Songs vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he cant help but fall for Shins young wife OK-vin Kim Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lovers The film from there goes in weird directions that I think one should experience for themselves What really should be mentioned is Chan-wook Parks mastery of the medium of cinema My God Ive rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers The major flaw of the film is that its a little incoherent especially near the beginning Park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals which can be difficult to follow at times But when it works man does it fly The film is also perversely hilarious The final sequence easily one of the best of the decade is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous OK-vin Kim should become a worldwide star after this film She gives one of the best performances of the year
I wont bore you with any synopsis chances are you already know them And hopefully you are already familiar with Park Chan-Wooks workbr br I STRONGLY disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that Park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah Because you know what? He HAS!!! The vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of Sympathy For Mr Vengeance with the frantic and extravagance of Oldboy? Park Chan-Wook has incredible style but his movies dont all share the SAME style! That has been true and remains true with the release of Thirst br br Thirst is an incredible picture it literally has EVERYTHING you want in a movie Jaw-dropping violence tasteful gore great humour incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes The story is so crazy that at no point can you guess what will happen next Im so happy to say that Park is back in top form with this fantastic dark-comic-vampire-love-story Watch it as soon as you can!
Thirstbr br I found that this film was beautifully crafted The cinematography was well above excellent I though almost any frame could be frozen and you would have yourself an exquisite photograph The use of color stands out most In many instances the camera was gliding through the scene and the work was flawlessbr br Park Chan Wooks direction was fantastic He had me believing unwaveringly in his far- fetched universe There were several touches of verbal and visual humor (of a dark nature) that just added another depth to the picture as a wholebr br The acting I would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enoughbr br For me the only place where this film lacked was in the story At times I will not lie the goings on between characters just did not make sense Sometimes the story flow was clunky Overall I was disappointed with the subdued narrative and I felt it ran a little too longbr br But I still recommend this film for its vision its visual flourish its dark humor and at the end of the day it is an interesting film even if imperfect 910
If you love Chan-wook Park you know what to expect His films are brutal poetic tragic and artistic with splashes of very grim humor THIRST is clearly Parks style and I loved every second of it from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story which blends Shakespearean tragedy murderous love Gothic horror and layered character drama The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR VENGEANCE there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing Chan-wook Park is an intelligent bold consistently surprising filmmaker Its unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart-wrenching to laugh-out-loud hilarious in an instant This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE then SYMPATHY FOR MR VENGEANCE as far as being over-the-top and comical But like LADY VENGEANCE its incredibly rich thought-provoking and rewardingbr br If you like beautifully told vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park seeing THIRST should be obvious Easily one of the best films of 2009
Not for the squeamish but the number of twists inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology gorgeous visual extremes together with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most stunning horror films Ive ever seen It descends into utter madness along with characters but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose There are copious amounts of bloodletting accompanied by some nasty sucking and squishing sounds but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud As he tends to do Chan-wook Park keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters br br And theres a lot of literal leaping Keeping in the vein of vampire myth (pun intended) they have superhuman strength and can nearly leap tall buildings in a single bound (to coin a phrase) The first time our heroine is carried by the across the tops of buildings by the troubled vampire priest it has all the magical romance of Lois Lane and Superman - but this romance becomes increasingly disturbing - but driven by a strange and conflicted love affair not by mere horrorbr br The acting is superb particularly OK-vin Kim the gorgeous actress in the female lead role who at 22 shows a range that is remarkable The character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type She careens from innocent to impish to vixen to demon with utter conviction This is a really smooth and nervy performance br br If you love real art in horror or are a fan of Oldboy - dont wait for the video see it immediately
I know little or nothing about astronomy but nevertheless; I was at first a little sceptical about the plot of this movie It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers The plot does sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and as you know Saturn is the emotion planet it all falls into place; makes complete sense and its then that you know you arent simply watching another silly 80s slasher with a pea brain plot Thank god for that! Seriously though Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise but it more than makes up for that with its originality Having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema but when given the choice between this and another dull Friday the 13th clone - I know what Id choosebr br Also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think its silly plot dug it into is the fact that its extremely entertaining Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore This film however keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids (which harks back to creepy kid classics such as Village of the Damned) a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension One thing that I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry Theres nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (cough Halloween cough) but thats not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows There wasnt any room for a chainsaw which is a huge shame but I suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it
Three children are born at the exact same timeduring a lunar eclipseJust before their 10th birthday they embark on a killing spreeBloody Birthday is a typical slasher from early 80sIts a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudityThe evil children never generate any menace and there is almost no suspenseThere is also no gore or scares in Bloody Birthdaybut the film is mildly entertainingUnfortunately no real explanation is provided for the kids sudden homicidal maniaThe murder scenes are quite gruesome for example weve got death by handgunbaseball batskipping rope and shovelSo if youre a fan of early 80s slasher movies give this one a look
I thought I was going to watch another Friday The 13th or a Halloween rip off But I was surprised Its about 3 psycho kids who kill Theres not too many movies like that I can think of Mikey Children Of The Corn and a few others Its not the greatest horror movie but its a least worth a rent
Three kids are born during a solar eclipse and turn into vile murderous little tykes whore above suspicion by everyone save for Joyce (Lori Lethin) and her younger brother Timmy Thats the story in a nutshell The acting in this one is tolerable for the most part Notable for MTV-J Julie Brown (not the Downtown one) showing some skin and a very early part (albiet small) for Michael Dudikoff Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but in the killer kids sub-genre its a bit of a guilty pleasurebr br Eye Candy: Julie Brown shows T&A (the only film thus far to claim that honor); Sylvia Wright gets topless br br DVD Extras (R1): 16 minute interview with Producer Max Rosenberg (wherein he insults the director AND Canada great stuff); Biography of Ed Hunt; and trailers for Kiss of the Taratula Dont open the Door & a red-band one for Homework (which features nudity) br br My Grade: B-
Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers Nice-girl local teen Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanorsbr br Hearkening back to films like The Bad Seed and Village of the Damned this films premise of evil children may not be wholly original but its still pretty disturbing All three of the child actors - Elizabeth Hoy Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman - are chillingly convincing Director Ed Hunt and his co-writer Barry Pearson maintain the unpleasant yet compelling mood for the duration of the film; they go so far as to have the little girl charge admission for an unwilling peep show involving her older sister (future stand-up comedienne and MTV personality Julie Brown whose striptease is a real eyeful)br br Name actors Susan Strasberg as an icy teacher and Jose Ferrer with barely any screen time as a doctor add to the proceedings with their presence while KC Martel one of the youngsters from the original The Amityville Horror is very likable as Joyces kid brother Other familiar faces like Ellen Geer B-movie he-man Michael Dudikoff Cyril OReilly (Porkys Dance of the Damned) Joe Penny (Jake and the Fatman) and William Boyett (The Hidden) can be seen as wellbr br Touching upon such parental fears as children playing with guns that theyve discovered and being locked inside old refrigerators Bloody Birthday is a little more than just a slasher variation with kids as antagonists Aided and abetted by Arlon Obers music score this film sticks in the memory more than some of its brethren without lots of gore to fall back on (although that arrow through the eye gag works quite well)br br Bleak nasty and downbeat Bloody Birthday is worth a look for the curiousbr br 710
Story about three eclipse (maybe even Indigo ha) children beginning their love for murder Oh and the people who are hot on their trailbr br Bloody Birthday a pretty mediocre title for the film was a nice lil surprise I was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood-thirsty psychopath kids And I may say its also one of the best flicks Ive seen with kids as the villains By the end of the movie I seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashionbr br Its a really solid 80s horror flick but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you cant not think about Even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil sh!ts as the murderers But there seems to be only a couple police in town well by the end only one and he seemed like a dimwit so I suppose they could have gotten away with it Haha yeah and Im a Chinese jet-pilotbr br Nevertheless this movie delivered some evilass kids who were more than entertaining a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage No kiddin! If youre put off by the less than stellar title dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot Its a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters Steven (Andy Freeman) Curtis (Billy Jayne;credited as Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) were all born on the same day during an eclipse Besides sharing a birthday they also share a love of murder (and theyre not picky about who they kill either) Young Billy Elizabeth and Andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too But they cant go on fooling everyone This is an overall good horror flick its not too unrealistic there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well (the grown-ups are pretty hammy though) Id say its well worth seeing (I own a copy myself)
This agreeably perverse and oddball early 80s teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent pinnacle of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous moppets movie Devil Times Five but its still an above average killer kid opus nonethelessbr br The slim but serviceable plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes -- two bratty boys and one creepily twinkle-eyed albeit angelic-looking little girl -- who are all born during a solar eclipse on June 9th 1970 When the strange antisocial trio who stick together in a tightly self-contained and exclusive circle reach ten years of age they suddenly go homicidally bonkers and declare open season on the hapless unsuspecting local yokels of the heretofore sleepy and peaceful California suburb of Meadowvale Writerdirector Ed Hunt the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey Starship Invasions the uproariously inane Jesus Christ vigilante parable (!) Alien Warrior and the stunningly silly The Brain does a pretty solid and capable job here: the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal (the arrow-through-the-eye gag is especially nasty) theres a sizable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft-core sex a goodly amount of tension is neatly created and maintained some nice dollops of dark humor punctuate the arrestingly warped mayhem and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly joltingbr br Moreover the top-drawer cast further elevates the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing: Jose Ferror as a small-town doctor future Jake and the Fatman TV series star Joe Penny as an amateur astrologer The Prey s Lori Lethin as the plucky babysitter heroine Susan Strasberg as a bitchy school teacher American Ninja s Michael Dudikoff as a chowderhead jock and Cyril OReilly (the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy Dance of the Damned) as a libidinous teen dude who gets bagged while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a parked van Billy Jacoby (who went on to star in such late 80s direct-to-video dross as Dr Alien and Demonwarp) Andy Freeman and especially the eerily adorable Elizabeth Hoy are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible troika of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats And yes thats none other than Julie Brown the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise Top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune The Homecoming Queens Gotta Gun as the lovely vacuous full-breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy totally extraneous yet still sizzling and much-appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song! All in all this baby sizes up as a sturdy and satisfying slasher item
This movie is great 80s sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse so they kill everyone they see The reason they kill makes practically no sense but it just adds to the charm of this movie And dang these kids are crazy especially Curtis If youve seen the movie you know who I am talking about That kids vicous! Although the movie doesnt have much gore it is entertaining and for some reason you kind of care about the characters It also has some nice nudity Has some decent acting as well really a decent 80s slasher movie its worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it Youll have nightmares about those darn kids though I guarantee you!
Sorry about the extremely clever summary phrase I dont know what I was thinking but I really couldnt help myselfbr br Ive been meaning to see Bloody Birthday for a long time and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price And believe me I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely to happen Its a real shame that some of these gems from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten Bloody Birthday is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays Not a masterpiece for sure but still entertaining and guess what? it doesnt really have unintentionally funny scenes I know its a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people But trust me the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most partbr br In Blood Birthday the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse According to astrology during eclipses the sun and the moon block Saturn which controls emotions As a consequence the three children who are born that day eventually become uncaring and evil Since they dont experience any feelings of remorse whatsoever these 10-year-old kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way including their own parents and siblings and kill them! The body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that theres a psychopath lurking around the place In the meantime Debbie Curtis and Steven dont hesitate to keep butchering people since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces (?)br br Like I was saying before Bloody Birthday is surprisingly NOT funny I know I said that before but Im truly surprised by this I was expecting some hilariously bad scenes but the movie proved me wrong True its not exactly what most people would consider a serious horror movie but if I have to be fair Id say that the story is decently executed One of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations (like I did) its because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable Lets face it: kids tend to be horrible actors which is understandable and we cant blame them for that But to my surprise the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny The rest of the actors are also good and if youre a George Clooney fan you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie Yeah I know right? who cares? Also Julie Brown the great actress singer comedienne and gay icon gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked Too bad she didnt have more time on the screen though! Julie is absolutely fabulous:Pbr br So basically this movie is fine if youre in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s My only objection regarding Bloody Birthday would be the way to justify the childrens motives This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film Lets see: if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people? Im sure there were other children who had been born the same day and during other days of total eclipse too oh well! Overall no big deal its just a simple observation thats all Ive seen worse trust me Take The Children (1980) for example in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud No believe me Bloody Birthday is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers youre going to enjoy this one very muchbr br So now you know: youre invited to the childrens birthday party and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests Come on you cant miss it ;)
Three ten-year-old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends thembr br While killer kid movies werent exactly new at the time of this twisted 80s slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film Bloody Birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities It straddles a fine line between cheesy and creepy but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot Theres some strong murder scenes as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasurebr br The cast does a fairly good job Young stars Elizabeth Hoy and KC Martel deliver some menacing performances while rising star Julie Brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well as the teacher and Jose Ferrer has a cameo appearancebr br All around this off-beat slasher entry isnt bad though its admittedly not flawless but it is well worth watching for genre fansbr br  out of 
This movie is not the scariest of all time but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget no stars lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well A nice starting point for Just Say Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career This film wont be seen by many but for fans of 80s horror its a must
An absolute classic of 80s scare flix This one isnt like any other as it pits pint-size wild-eyed psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown-ups in town Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (80s gold again) plays one of the killer-kids and hes paired up with one of the little girls Jake Blues tries to purchase in the BLUES BROTHERS There is a third blond boy but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots The demonic gang of smiling kids though somehow possessed by extra-planetary means bear little resemblance to the droid-ish Children of the Damned who never thought to use pistols crossbows and shovels to kill those pesky adults Julie Brown (not Downtown Julie Brown-the other one) shows her rack like three times as she dances around in her bedroom This movie is a rarity that I cannot believe I missed growing up in the 80s This would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if I had seen it Where is the sequel the ending begs for? This movie is just incredible Seek it out at all costs
I cant believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely wont be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that Bloody Birthday is awful viewing On the contrary I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers Dont just refer to this film as being another 80s slasher because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers Were introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse At the moment they were delivered planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience This really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spreebr br Granted this stuff is incredibility far-fetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who cares? Unlike many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative For once the kids acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music The murders sequences are grim and tense and its always eerie to see them getting committed by angel-faced kids I dont know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job Especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable The bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as Village of the Damned The Bad Seed and Children of the Damned This film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this br br Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt Not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like The Brain and Starship Invasions If all this isnt enough to convince you yet Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity And not just any nudity but a topless dance-act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown Oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by Joe Penny later the star of TV-series Jake and the Fatman Check it out!!
Interesting cartoon included on the DVD of The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra I especially like the way the color was used in the background art--very artistic for Columbia whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it!)br br I do wonder however how a certain um finger gesture ever got past the censors Granted the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today Youd think someone besides the animators would have noticed though--especially since its seen three times in the scene in question! And based on the context I suspect that its inclusion was intentional something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors WOULD notice!
Having just seen Walt Disneys The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks The colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another ones off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short It does get a little repetitious near the end Still Skeleton Frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier Silly Symphony
In 1929 director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their Silly Symphonies series The Skeleton Dance Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in Disneys Laugh-O-Gram cartoon series; however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio That was the birth of Celebrity Productions where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog) While his work kept the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed Later that year Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in colorbr br 1937s Skeleton Frolics is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic The Skeleton Dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune Like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play The dead rise from their coffins ready for the show thats about to begin as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune Now its not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra: its hard to dance with loose body parts Everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their gravesbr br Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself Skeleton Frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by The Skeleton Dance years before although with a crucial difference: Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor The bright tonalities allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before It is certainly a more experimental film than The Skeleton Dance although sadly this doesnt mean its necessarily a better film For starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney with the only differences being the music (more on that later) and the color effects It looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after allbr br However it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film (after all Iwerks executes it in a wonderful way) but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl W Stalling for The Skeleton Dance In other words while DeNats tune is effective and appropriate for the theme its easy to forget about it rapidly while Stallings song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable Being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down Iwerks flawless work of animation Personally I think that with a better musical accompaniment Skeleton Frolics would be remembered as fondly as The Skeleton Dance despite not being as groundbreaking as its still a fun film to watchbr br Its kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disneys main rival) he did not lack the quality of those companies films It was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to Disneys mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney Despite its shortcomings Skeleton Frolics is a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film (one just cant help but thinking of The Skeleton Dance while watching it) it definitely reminds us that Iwerks skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire usbr br 810
First time I saw this great movie and Alyssa my star playing Frances Ella Fitz was so great in this movie! It was just so real and her little dog so cute!

Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages The movie focuses around Fizzy (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell) What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget This tv film was just great The acting is #1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation It is also based on a true storybr br 1010
Here is a movie of adventure determination heroism & bravery Plus its set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting Its a wonderful adventurous storyline and Alyssa Milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome confident no-nonsense Fizzya great role-model This is one of my favorite movies It is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt Not only is the storyline excellent but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed This movie is as good as gold!
While Boris(Aleksey Batalov)is off to fight in war against the Germans for his Mother Russia his beloved Veronika(Tatyana Samojlova)marries his conniving cousin Mark(Aleksandr Shvorin)in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over Moscow Through various trials and betrayals Veronika will await word or letter from Boris no matter how long it takes holding hope that he will return to herbr br Powerful piece of film-making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky Some of the many magnificently framed moving shots include the scene where the camera follows Veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to Borisand doesnt quite reach him even as we watch Boris looking impatiently into the swarm without luck The sequence after the air raid where Veronika walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where Mark makes his lustful move on Veronika as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light emanate inside are just two of MANY examples where Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film But without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly deeply love each other this film couldnt hold up with the beauty of the visual alone Together however were left with an amazing filmsimply a haunting masterpiece from the Soviet Union after Stalin breathed his last breath I feel honored just have beheld such a great film
In my review just submitted I referred to the young actress lead as Katerina when it should have been Veronika I was so involved with character and the action I guess that I wasnt that concerned with names Anyway she and the film are brilliant As I said the cinematography and the directors use of montage are worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman Tisse The production design is top notch The placement of actors in the foreground middle ground and background within any given mise en scene is worthy of study Stunning memorable camera movement and an ending that has an emotional punch that leaves Hollywood films far behind Gee! Heroic self sacrifice instead of walking into the rainbow Thanks again John Hart
This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema By seeing this filmwe can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgysuch a strong and adequate use of sound-image montageand almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life Cinema was then not only one form of arts It was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war It is said that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years! Audience that time was also different I read that after seeing Kurosawas Ikiru(Live) in its first release young couple quietly told each otherIt is a good film isnt it? I thinkcontemporary cinema though technically developed and opened some new narrative perspective has lost the most important---reliance of audienceCienma was once really the most popular art from and unlike modern fine arts and contemporary musicgave millions of people hope and ideals In this point of viewLetyat zhuravli must be in the pantheon of classics of all the time as City lightIkiru and La Strada
I watched this movie on TCM last night all excited expectation having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto I told my wife who hadnt seen it before to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot no cuts where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus and darts among the tanks to cross the road THEN I remember that no cuts we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through anxiously looking for him but does not find him But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women all extras and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior How one wonders did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street dodging the tanks the scene abruptly ended and cut back to scenes at the apartment before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence Seems to me that this film was not only restored but also re-edited What a downer!
If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war you need to see Letyat zhuravli (called The Cranes are Flying in English) It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) who are in love on the verge of WWII They are walking along the waterfront watching the cranes fly by when the war starts Boris is promptly sent off to war Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son whom she does not love Boris meanwhile continues trotting through the countryside fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war until he he runs out of energy When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news she refuses to accept it until Boris body arrives home on one of the trains Simultaneously the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allied Powers have won the war; the Soviet Union lost 27 million citizens but its the start of a new erabr br This movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield but also how it affected the civilian population This is definitely a movie that everyone should see
This is a magnificent and in many ways impressive film I saw it on TV as a little boy with my throat almost strangled with tears and again today on the magnificently restored Criterion DVDbr br Cranes is the very essence of the War Weepie Imagine Umbrellas of Cherbourg with no music and no color or Waterloo Bridge with no class consciousnessbr br Tatiana Samoilova a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé enlists and doesnt write or come backbr br The fiancé Boris dies on the front and his death scene is indescribably romantic Very daring too because so close to over the top But that scene will stay with youbr br Although the Soviets were so defined by WWII the movie is quite unspecific and more powerful for it The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel There is no attempt at period detail The whole film becomes more and more stylized until the Siberian scenes which feel like a modern opera set (that is a compliment) The cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop - there again comparable to Cherbourg The production feels like a big budget (those staircase scenes must have cost a pretty kopek)br br Go for it Dont expect a bitter socialist pill (although it is of course very sad) The Cranes are Flying is an impressive slice of world cinema quite advanced considering where and when it was made
Im out of words to describe the beauty of The Cranes are Flying but Ill try anyway to write about it Its a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the Second World War Its the classic story of lovers (Boris & Veronika) separated by the war and of what comes between them The films images are so gorgeous that youll be carried away - the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotionbr br There are few scenes that portray directly the war: A bombing - wind lightnings explosions - that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist Veronika who waits for the return of Boris; and theres another scene on the front where we we will be confronted by a emotionalvisual hurricane showing the images played in Boris mind Another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title - the cranes flying in the sky This image stands as a the symbol for Nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film: Not to give up hope and fight for a better futurebr br Kalatozov is a great director this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply It is not just pure technique br br Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika What more can I say? The film transcends the time it was made - the action takes place during the Second World War But it could have happened anytime anywhere As long there are wars (great or small) the film and its message will remain relevant
Sick of the current cinema output particularly American cinema Ive been making an effort to see the Oscar-winning foreign films Thats when I came across this gem Slow to start it picks up nicely once war is declared Basically an old fashioned girl-waits-for-boy-to-return-from-war-story the performances the cinematography make this so very much more Why Tatyana Samojlova as the young woman didnt become an international star after this is beyond me(though she has remained successful in her own country) You take the journey with her: young defiant impetuous young girl who through the ravages of war becomes a very sober somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope (her final scene is devastating) We love her as much as the camera does And the camera-work! Was this the pioneer in hand-held camera work? It truly adds an immediacy to the story And the beauty of it (like when Tatyanas character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence) I am humbled and grateful to see this film
This is a fantastic film The acting is some of the best Ive seen Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting The The cinematography was extremely ahead of its time Watching it I could see parallels of cinematography used today This is truly a groundbreaking film Because of the cinematography and acting the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes Its a very touching and powerful piece My friend told me it was must see and I definitely agree with her This is one of those films that you watch and never forget Everyone should see this intensely moving film This should be put on everyones Movies to See Before ________ (whatever) list
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work The opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographers album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look All is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking Difficult to describe without spoiling but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lovers brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter Another superimposes a swirling staircase and a spinning shot of tree tops and even develops into a fantasy sequence Soviet film making of the highest order
Director Mikhail Kalatozovs film The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov based on his own play Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable However this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us straight from a soldiers mouth how war is hated by all that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting we see a new vision of WWII We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they dont believe in With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East and how people are dying for no reason against their will its nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are as well as those awaiting their returnbr br Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war While Boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not I dont know There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country it is all praise and thanks Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everydaybr br The acting is top-notch throughout but some deserve singling out I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris grandmother She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language Vasili Merkuryev as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich brings what is perhaps the best performance As spoken at the end about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments He puts on a tough exterior especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave But when Boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man seated in sorrow at the table He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him his actions throughout the film express it to the audience Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris a happy-go-lucky young man and idealist doing what he believes is right and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark staying home due to his talented piano skills or maybe just to steal his cousins love That love played by Tatyana Samojlova really draws the audience in to her grief dejection and slim glimmer of hope The true star of the film she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way needing to steer back on course hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris returnbr br Besides the realism to the story as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across I also loved the visual style of the film Sergei Urusevskys cinematography is amazing especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water a bridge in the background at the top as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times Sharp angles are utilized as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame togetherbr br The real feats however are those instances of the long shot Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris her own farewell needing to be said The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people the camera focuses on couples kisses people yelling to one another and more all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through Everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema Its just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en scène can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible Composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do
Mikhail Kalatozovs The Cranes are flying is a superb film Winner of the golden palm at Cannes Film Festival it has an excellent cinematography and performance by Tatyana Samojlova the only Russian actor ever to win an award in Cannes for a performance She plays Veronika a teenager in love with her boyfriend happy and without preoccupations with plans of getting married Her life will get upside down when World War II strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army The film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight waiting for a letter or other information It is a portrayal of lost innocence Samojlova does a magnificent job and her character transformation will break your heart The camera movement is fast with a lot of close-ups it is a dancing camera The first scene in the stairs is fantastic but it isnt the only one there is later a scene when Veronika attempts committing suicide and another in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history the bombing of Veronikas house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire to find her apartment completely destroyed Simply great! 10 out of 10
Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilmentbr br In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreamsbr br But Man is not a bird Life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort War breaks out and without much hesitation Boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty He cannot even say good-bye to Veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away Surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract Boris attention must inevitably failbr br Boris eventually gets killed in war without Veronica learning about it for the moment His brother Mark a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption is eager to take his place Veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms A marriage takes place which is never accepted by the familybr br Soon feelings of guilt seize hold of Veronica and she realizes that Boris return is the one and only thing she actually longs for She therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the self-sacrificing work in a field hospitalbr br When war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers Again Veronica is among them forcing her way through a wall of bodies In her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris deathbr br Once again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines But now Veronica is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one She has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams For all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fatebr br 
Its not difficult after watching this film to see why post-silent Soviet cinema is held in such little critical esteem Dont get me wrong THE CRANES ARE FLYING is for the first half at least supremely entertaining boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin; a fresh brisk spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms; two stunning subjective set-pieces; and a romantic verve that flirts with but never quite topples into Lelouch territory Its just that  in its subsuming of vast social national and world events to a love affair it is essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood moviebr br Of course in a Soviet Union that emphasised the state above all else and in an era (World War Two) that suppressed individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism this foregrounding of two appealing young lovers is a relief And the thematic similarities - all consuming love rent apart by war - with two of the most wonderful of all films (SEVENTH HEAVEN LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also adds to its potential loveabilitybr br The story is simple enough Boris a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family and Veronika a student conduct a breezy relationship at night their only free time Boriss cousin Mark a composer also has eyes on Veronika When the Nazis invade Russia Boris secretly volunteers to the chagrin of his family and lover He promises to write to Veronika but never does thinking maybe she hasnt bothered to see him off or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable Veronikas parents die during an air raid and she moves in with Boriss family helping out at the hospital where his father tends wounded soldiersbr br Distressed by Boriss silence Veronika is also assailed by the attentions of Mark who has gained exemption from military duty by bribing a local official She is eventually worn down and marries him to the disapproval of her adopted family Boris meanwhile is killed in action Veronika disgusted with herself and an adulterous Mark refuses to believe this and awaits his return fostering a young orphan bearing his namebr br The title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love symbolic perhaps of its transcendant epiphanical power But this is illusory - the cranes fly in a V formation and this shape pervades the entire film through the geometric shapes of buildings interiors exteriors groupings of people composition camera angles the heroines name - or by editing in which feet walking southwest in one story are met by feet walking southeast in another br br This serves to fatally trap the lovers who have no control over their destinies and also suggest the Stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film Although the pair seem to be free in space whether literally in an unpeopled environment or privileged in generous close-ups they are always ironised minimised torn apart - by circumstances families by crowds (see the brilliant if obvious sequences where Veronika is engulfed by tanks or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd) or simply by the films structure which is constantly distancing through paralellism their closeness Although at the beginning the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll it is constantly being broken by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of musicbr br What is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasising historical forces The whole film but especially the war itself is strangely unreal and dreamlike we are never shown its harsh brutal actuality just its effects on the lovers In fact it is transformed into a majestic spectacle devoid of nasty Germans br br On the home front the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade or ruins of almost Gothic decadence In the bunker the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than Boriss perceived indifference The empty oneiric Moscow spaces the lovers initially than Veronika with her mother walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces br br When Mark tries to force himself on Veronika the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations This is a brilliant sequence filmed with silent Expressionistic terror in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence all the more compelling for the earlier scenes wistful gentlenessbr br Its not much different at the front either where fights over girls honour are more urgent than tactics Nazis or despair The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is a further abstracting of the experience of war its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic; and Boris final pre-death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream-wish fulfillment and heightened anxiety in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesquebr br From this point on the film becomes a little less interesting slightly more obvious One more grasp for Expressionist overload - Veronikas attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant - is clumsily handled; and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film The use of deep focus at first ravishing soon becomes wearing devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning Welles brought to its use in CITIZEN KANE After what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end when individual suffering as so often in Russian art transmutes into symbolic (ie sexless dehumanised) hope A pity
Unlike the many who have posted here Im not movie literate I stumbled across this movie by accident (channel surfing) and couldnt surf away This is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it The actors are terrific Tatiana is beautiful and innocent Her fiancé Boris is sweet and patriotic You couldnt help but feel Boris fathers exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great warbr br Others have summarized the movie so well so Ill just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most When Boris brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry Tatiana Tatianas twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal (even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape) You fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on Tatiana and the brother or worse show Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence Since this isnt French existential cinema the latter doesnt happen Thankfully! br br Another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris father of the death of his son He unwittingly breaks the news to Tatiana I cant describe the sorrow of this scene StillTatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that Boris will yet come home The musician actually never saw Boris buried after allbr br I wont mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches of Soviet political correctness didnt detract at all from the film Boris brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brothers wife-to-be would have to be No doubt he gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film! The ending when Tatiana finally learns for certain that Boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future You dont even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war with their own losses in mind first saw this moviebr br Incredible Go see it
The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema In the early years of the 1950s film production came close to a complete standstill {a mere nine feature-films were released in 1951} and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored and often censored by the government Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years It wasnt until 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is widely-considered the first post-Stalin Soviet masterpiece Letyat zhuravli  The Cranes are Flying one of the finest depictions of war Ive seen from any country or time period Not only was the film lauded for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union but international recognition was soon to follow and Kalatozovs film was honoured with the Palm dOr at the 1958 Cannes Film Festivalbr br The Cranes are Flying is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious humanistic portrayal of war Unlike many Soviet war-themed films of the time it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional war-time hero and more concerned with the futility brutality and indeed the inevitability of conflict Love as a cinematic concept is too-often idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship and yet the reality is substantially less romantic In the film two lovers Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) separated by the advent of the WWII {widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945} pledge to marry after the war but tragedy denies the couple their wish Driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting Veronika agrees to wed Boris cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) a handsome but unworthy youth The film may conclude with the proud victory of the Soviets and a patriotic flag-waving parade but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist who wanders soullessly through the celebrating crowdsbr br Perhaps the most remarkable feature of The Cranes are Flying is Sergei Urusevskys inspired and dynamic hand-held cinematography which realistically and dizzily captures the chaos and confusion of war not necessarily in the hail of gunfire and the cries of dying comrades {in fact only one of the films sequences joins Boris on the Eastern Front} but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind In one particularly impressive oft-cited long shot the camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families The hand-held camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus jostles through the crowd alongside her - capturing momentary snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands - before unexpectedly craning above the crowd as Veronika disappears into the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode Urusevsky first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of hand-held photography: The camera he once declared can express what the actor is unable to portray: his inner sensations The cameraman must act with the actors
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and its not difficult to see why (A few spoilers - but for the ending youll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family Mark Boris cousin rapes Veronika who feels obligated to marry him Degraded and demeaned by the cowardly Mark Veronika clings to the hope that someday Boris will return Superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director Kalatozov (For anyone interested in film technique another movie by Kalatozov I AM CUBA has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana rises two stories to a cigar factory tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long long avenue - all without a cut) Superb acting particularly by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris uncle) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement A devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by Samoilova (This movie is frequently linked with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier)
Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of the young Audrey Hepburn and the camera in THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her just as much She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of World War II in Moscowbr br The film is almost poetic in its gorgeous B&W cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place since I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on TCMbr br Its a very moving love story about a girls deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime Russia Shes unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from Their marriage is a troubled one because she cant let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheartbr br By the end of the story she accepts the idea that hes never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation Theres a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous familiesbr br The stylish and striking camera-work is what carries the film as well as the honestly played storybr br Tastefully done but perhaps the English subtitles didnt tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed overbr br Summing up: Easy to see why it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival Reminded me in style of another great Russian film BALLAD OF A SOLDIER
While watching this film recently I constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957and in the USSR! That makes it all the more remarkable Many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002 but they were quite original in 1957 I first saw this film in 1963 when it was first released in the US and I was struck by its originality then Now just having seen it 40 years later I have no reason to change my mind
I had long wanted to watch this romantic drama (with a WWII setting) and now that I have all I can say is that its a veritable masterpiece of Russian cinema! br br Soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but thankfully this ones free of such emphasis - with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which hell never return The girl (a remarkable performance from Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young mans cousin and when she doesnt receive word from her boyfriend gives in to the latter and marries him He however is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and knowing too that the girls still devoted to the soldier begins to neglect her Finally word reaches the girl of her loved ones death but by the end of the film she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of himbr br The film features some truly amazing camera-work which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and by frequently adopting tracking tilted and high or low angle shots renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama Individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: the stunning scene frenetically edited and sped-up to boot in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck; and the young mans premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front undoubtedly one of the best of its kind Ive ever watched (with the sun moving away from him symbolizing the life thats seeping out of his body as he imagines the wedding day hell never have!) Also notable however is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home thats been hopelessly devastated during an air raid; as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist - which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face - taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains!br br Disappointingly the R1 DVD of this outstanding film is a bare-bones affair (the RusCiCo edition features a few supplements but being an export tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot!); Criterion released it in conjunction with another war-themed Russian classic BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959) - which my pal at the local DVD rental outlet has told me is forthcoming br br The only other film Ive watched from this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969; albeit via the much-shorter US-release version!) a star-studded international production based on true events; given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING I regret missing out now on his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) a number of times when I was in Hollywood late last year: apart from receiving a one-week theatrical run it was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a feature-length Making Of!!
A true masterpiece of the Soviet cinematography Its a shame for the Soviet Union that Samojlova was never given an opportunity to play in the Western movies -- but then again she would probably never find herself there In Letyat Zhuravli she is unforgettable This was one of the few movies where I was cryingbr br In addition to Samojlova Batalov and Merkurjev who are top rate it was a brilliant work of the director and the operator which made this movie an all-time classics world-wide Just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy German bombardment or the death of Boris with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies The very simple means -- but the great technique added to the emotional weight Mind you 20 years before The Star Wars 41 years before Titanic and with a Soviet budget
In Moscow the young couple Veronika (T Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are in deep love for each other With the World War II Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before Veronikas birthday and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other While waiting for news from Boris Veronika is raped by Boris cousin Mark (A Shvorin) and they marry each other However Veronika does not forget Boris and keeps waiting for himbr br Letyat zhuravli is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in times of war The direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story inclusive in the capital scene when Veronika is raped by Mark The camera-work is amazing with sophisticated planes and angles and long traveling The scenes of Veronika in the middle of the tanks or in the train station with many figurants are awesome The magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the DVD T Samojlova has an extremely beautiful face and a touching and sensitive performance The speech in the last scene makes another great example of an anti-war movie My vote is ninebr br Title (Brazil): Quando Voam as Cegonhas (When Fly the Stork)
It does not surprise me that this short (91 minutes) BW movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ottepel or the thaw has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world It is sublime and beautifully filmed Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time Sergei Urusevskys camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman It is also the film about loyalty memories ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for; it is about forgiveness and about hope The film received (absolutely deservingly) the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at Cannes for playing Veronika the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie After separation with her beloved who went to the front the loss of her family in the bomb ride and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed she turned to the shadow of herself she became dead inside Her long journey to redemption to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply wont leave any viewer indifferentbr br For me the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning I walked the same streets squares and bridges over the Moskva River Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger cold and illnesses during WWII and my family is not exception My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books Cranes are Flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply It is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life - my background my memory and my past
One of those films that I happened across through The Criterion Collection and as usual indulged as a change of pace That turned out to be a great decision I was almost mesmerised by the quality of the film the story it told and the way it was told The almost minimalist feel to the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a whole evocative level to the film This really is a superb film to spend some time with and enjoy
I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie If at one point or another you thought youve seen good camera work be prepared to be amazed by this movie For the record this movie was made in 1957 in Russia but the technique used here is probably something that weve seen much later in the western worldabout 20 years later The level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot: happiness -love-war- despair-joy but in the end you remain with something quite unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking The young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similareven though I think movies like this are very hard to come by If youve seen I am Cuba  then this movie would appeal to you very much but if not be prepared for a unique experience The Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets great actors and a joy of creating artand yes they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together I am not a big fan of Russia actually I hate everything thats communist but the film making in that part of the world manages to create such feelings that are hard to describebr br Enjoy itbr br 
The plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind: the violent clash between Adolf Hitlers Germany and Soviet Russia from 1941-45br br With the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated and 20 to 30 million Russian people killed the vibes of this conflict can be felt in Russia up to the present day Let alone back in 1957 when memories were still very fresh and painfulbr br This very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of Letjat zhuravlis beautiful shots Its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war: bravery love patriotism weakness cowardice and corruption All beautifully tied together by a toy-squirrelbr br Add to this the truly magnificent acting and its easy to understand why this movie is so famous Really one of the very best ever made br br 
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love was just as strong as in the West and war was often more poignant (should I say more realistic ?)br br This film is as much about war and love as it is about the Soviet thaw of Mr Ks era It also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990s with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of USD spent on special effects and marketed actorsbr br This movie is a classic of Soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies : warbr br 
If youre looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the testosterone-pumped carnage-craving war buffs out there dont bother Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII dont expect to see any Nazis cannons blood gore etc Its not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war Its a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with itbr br Acting cinematography writing: all perfect 10s here Youll certainly appreciate it if youre Russian like me but even if not youll probably love it If you speak no Russian look for the RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) DVD version Its got subtitles in about 14 different languages but the English dubbing on this one Id say is just as good Its of course not as good as the original Russian track (some stuff is lost in translation) but just as good as the English subtitles So go check it out especially if youre studying film in any aspect
1956 was the 20th Congress of the Communist Party and the Soviet Premier Krushchev made a speech denouncing Stalin and the Stalinist purges and the gulag labor systems revealing information that was previously forbidden publicly revealing horrible new truths which opened the door for a new Soviet Cinema led by Mikhail Kalatozov once Stalins head of film production This film features a Red Army that is NOT victorious in fact they are encircled in a retreat mode with many people dying including the hero in a film set after 06-02-41 the German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced the Barbarossa Plan a blitzkrieg invasion intended to bring about a quick victory and the ultimate enslavement of the Slavs and very nearly succeeded actually getting within 20 miles of Moscow in what was a Red Army wipe out a devastation of human losses 15 to 20 million Russians died or 20% of the entire population Historically this was a moment of great trauma and suffering a psychological shock to the Russian people but the Red Army held and prolonged the war 4 more years until they were ultimately victorious br br During the war Stalin used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting introducing female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy an obvious reference to Stalin himself who was always portrayed in film as a bold wise and victorious leader But Kalatozov changed this depiction as THE CRANES ARE FLYING was made after Stalins death causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm DOr as well as the Best Director and Best Actress (Tatyana Samoilova) reawakening the West to Soviet Cinema for the first time since Eisensteins IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 40s br br This film featured brilliant breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky using spectacular crane and tracking shots images of wartime battlefields Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real Another brilliant scene features the lead heroine Veronica who hasnt heard from her lover Boris in the 4 years at war so he is presumed dead but she continues to love him expressed in a scene where she runs towards a bridge with a train following behind her a moment when the viewer was wondering if she might throw herself in front of that train instead she saves a 3 yr old boy named Boris who was about to be hit by a car Another scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield who dies a senseless death and his thoughts spin and whirl in a beautiful montage of trees sky leaves all spinning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams including an imaginary wedding with Veronica This film features the famous line You can dream when the war is over In the final sequence when the war is over the soldiers are returning in a mass scene on the streets Veronica learns Boris died all are happy and excited with the soldiers return but Veronica is in despair passing out flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness revealing cranes white and gray floating in the sky br br The film was released in 1957 in Russia and according to some reviews the silence in the theater was profound the wall between art and living life had fallenand tears unlocked the doors br br  br br 
The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not admittedly all that original Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both Weve seen it many times beforebr br Nonetheless we havent seen it filmed this well with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation or destruction or hopelessness All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinemabr br I was reading Chekhovs Three Sisters the other day and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film In Act 2 Masha objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding:br br MASHA: Surely mankind must believe in something or at least seek for the truth otherwise life is just emptiness emptiness To live and not to know why the cranes are flying why children are born why there are stars in the sky Either you must know why it is you live or everything is trivial - mere pointless nonsensebr br Likewise Veronika has a hard time believing that the war and her and others sufferings have been pointless Better to assign a meaning to live as if ones life is significant and not to give in to despair It is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the filmbr br BTW as a minor correction to one other comment here--there may be a pattern of Vs in the film though I hadnt noticed them myself But the first letter of Veronikas name is not a further instance of this; in the Cyrillic alphabet her name begins with a letter which looks like an English B
Having long disdained network television programming I remember the first time I caught an episode of Police Squad! It was totally by accident It was during the shows initial network run on ABC in early 1982 I am a chronic channel surfer and was flipping the dial one evening when suddenly appeared Police Squad!s opening credit sequence on my TV screen I immediately recognized it as a sendup of the opening credits of M-Squad starring Lee Marvin one of my all-time favorite cop shows I stopped surfing Then of course came headquarters getting shot up followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln By now I was saying to myself What the heck is THIS?? Then came special guest star Georg Stanford Brown getting flattened by a plummeting safe I was hooked from that moment The episode was Ring of FearA Dangerous Assignment with its comic references to On The Waterfront and Muhammed Ali but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non sequiturs Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their loose parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of M Squad were an absolute riot Finally I said to myself A network television program truly worth watching!!! Wouldnt you know it would be canceled just a few weeks later Leave it to the networks -- I should have known Anyway I just bought the DVD collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago The Naked Gun movies were terrific as well but I really missed Alan North (he was so good as Ed Hocken) Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what were they thinking casting OJ in that part?) and especially William Duells Johnny the shoeshine guy Great stuff
Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words: Police Squad - in color you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcombr br Also to kill off a Guest Star and then never refer to him again where had you ever seen that before Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention you would miss several jokes in the background Dont pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry This was the show that video recorders were made for way before Married with Children or The Simpsonsbr br The stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before realising that it was a jokebr br The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came right out of Dragnet and they were absolutely straight (no funny accents or expressions) but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan Only once as I can remember were there a segment played for silly laughs - a scene involving a trip to a dentist suction and a whole lot of salivabr br There were some tedious moments - like the informer Johnny and an appearance by some celebrity That was strictly a one-joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes Oh well Everything cant be perfect The important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee deep in tears of laughterbr br Leslie Nielsen was fortunate that this revived his career when they put the Frank Drebin character in 3 features but it must have been an Achilles heel as well Can you remember seeing him in anything except Naked Gun type work since? And dont count the awful Mr Magoo reworked for live action He probably made a lot of money though
Two years after the success of Airplane Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great Leslie Nielsen as plain clothed detective Frank Drebin Also in the cast was Alan North as Captain Ed Hocken Ed Williams as Ted Olsen and William Duell as Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy Police Squad! featured unashamedly corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background Each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame in which the characters in frame stand completely still One of the best freeze frame sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still causing the cup to overflow! Guest stars were killed off in the opening titles one included Georg Stanford Brown being crushed by a falling safe! Despite gaining positive reviews and much critical acclaim Squad! only lasted for six episodes before being cancelled This didnt mean the end though five years later the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the Naked Gun films
I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show thanks to the many sight gags non sequitors and scripts filled with word play In one episode there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice br br But unfortunately ABC canceled the show after only six episodes I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode One that I remember was in the opening where the episodes title was different from the one shown on the screen br br Leslie Nielsens portrayal of Frank Drebin was deadpan yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet Alan North did well and Peter Lupus in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible wasnt bad as Norberg But the one character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy played by William Duell After giving advice to Drebin there were cameos from Dick Clark Dr Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda br br Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC the Zucker Brothers didnt give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise Ill close with a regular closing gag Freeze the ending right here
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1 2 & 3) this is fast-paced in your face rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses br br Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin an incompetent Detective who bumbles and fumbles his way through cases with the capable assistant of his boss Capt Ed Hockenbr br The story lines are spurious at best but its deliberate as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters br br The jokes themselves come in many forms be it wordplay slapstick puns or background gags most of them hitting the spot though some fall a little flat Its inevitable with this gag every few seconds approach that some will fail but the ratio is good br br The characters are a delight From the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of every episode the laboratory scientist who appears to be conducting cruel and unusual experiments on children to the shoe-shine who is some form of oracle the writing is witty and sharp as a cutlass br br Though not especially successful at the time it rapidly developed a cult following many blaming the shows relative lack of success on being way ahead of its time and too sophisticated for the target audience chief amongst them none other than Matt The Simpsons Groening: and he should know br br Dated by todays standards if you can see through that aspect youre in for a treat
The inspiration for the Naked Gun movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy - as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin always having to solve an absurd case Like Airplane! and the movies based on the series the humor relies on Mel Brooks-style spot gags and silly comments (namely the yes it is remarks) along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him And of course the final frame in which something keeps movingbr br Its too bad that the show only had six episodes At least it spawned the movies You cant go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in these sorts of roles I suspect that they all had fun filming it Really funnybr br Before Airplane! Leslie Nielsen had starred in movies like Forbidden Planet Harlow and The Poseidon Adventure As late as 1987 he co-starred in Nuts alongside Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss But since the first Naked Gun movie its been all comedy all the time
When I was young I was a big fan of the Naked Gun movies but just recently I watched the show Police Sqaud! and I think its great! Leslie Nielsons awesome Alan North is cool and who the heck is Rex Hamilton? But anyways its one goofy showbr br One of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits I think my favorite one is when Norberg (not OJ) walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame Classic!br br The only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old (when Drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks Cigarette? and the person replies Yes I know) I think they used it too many times by whateverbr br Good acting good gags great show!br br 710
I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams back in the early days at Comedy Central Back in those days (the 90s) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k complete with bearded hostbr br Capt Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced dead-pan filibuster Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show) boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios This is distilled 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now save it for later) Frank Drebin is clueless at most times a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable He is a master of the police investigative methodology (aka - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy) This does not make him a bad cop Cops get lucky also Capt Drebin (notice hes a Captain here) has perfected it Along with his partner Nordberg and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodesbr br The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote-ables Most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly The magic never came from the sight gagshowever At its core was a nonsensical and straight-faced conversation and activities in the foreground with crazy things occurring in the background The movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series Think of Monty Pythons And Now For Something Completely Differentbr br If you liked Airplane 1 & 2 Naked Gun 123 or Top Secret then you will definitely enjoy this br br I always liked the series better than the movies even though I saw the movies first Why? 2 words : No OJ
The creative team of Jim Abrahams David Zucker and Jerry Zucker had their roots in improvisational theatre in Madison Wisconsin I believe it was They had a group called Kentucky Fried Theatre(or something similar) They put a bunch of their set pieces onto celluloid asKENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE(1977) which was long irreverent sophomoric and really funnybr br They followed up with the very popular AIRPLANE! (1980) which really put them on the map In it they took some rather well known veteran actors in Robert Stack and (especially) Leslie Nielsen and putting them in prominent roles proceeded to parody every cliché of every aviation film since the days of John Waynes (Batjac)Production of THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (1954) Pockets stuffed with cash and now having been noticed the trio worked out a deal with Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company TV Network to do a half hour comedy spoof of the nearly countless Police Crime Drama show that have come and gone on our television screens over the years Remembering the fine job that Mr Leslie Nielsen had turned in on AIRPLANE! he was cast in the leadbr br As SgtLtCaptain Frank Drebbin (the rank designation switch being one of their comic bits)he presided over a great series of successive puns sight gags non sequitors and overblown policecrime clichésAll of these strung together by someseemingly standard scripts Added to this is overly dramatic opening narration voiced over information contradicting the visual printed info They always used this in giving the title of the episode titles where voice and printed titles never matchedbr br They had a great musical score which even though being somewhat exaggerated would have passed as theme and incidental music in a straight dramaThe musical score the opening titles and format of having the episodes divided into Act I Act II Epilogue etc were all part of obvious but affectionate ribbing of QM (Quinn Martin) Productions (They even had the same announcer as did the real QMs)br br One thing that this all too short of a series did not have was a technically augmented audience laughter And boy they sure didnt need any phony tract The nature of the spoof was such that it demanded the viewers close almost undivided attention and that proved to be the ultimate reason behind POLICE SQUADs downfallbr br In regards to the series cancellationan ABC Executive explained that the episodes called for too much attention on the part of the viewer So isnt that what one would want?br br So after only 6 wonderfully wacky hilarious episodesoff to the afterlife of series cancellation went POLICE SQUAD! only to be reborn in THE NAKED GUN trilogy made for the big screen in movie houses Once again they did quite well at the Box Office Oh well TVs loss is Cinemas gain thanks to you Mr Idiot TV Exec!br br  THE HIGH AND MIGHTY was produced by the Dukes own Batjac Productions and released by Warner Brothers It was unavailable for quite a number of years and finally Mr Waynes family made arrangements to release it to television and to video
After reading over all these reviews Im very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 NBC cop show M Squad starring Lee Marvin i read reviews comparing it to Dragnet and some of the Quinn Martin police shows but if you watch M Squad youll see it was based on it In the late 1958 episodes of M Squad onwards youll see Lee Marvin who plays Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger get out of his car and then hes shot atand he shoots back the beginning of Police Squad is basically the same ( including the Jazz music) and then Lee Marvin narrates what goes on (Im Lieutenant Detective Frank BallingerM Squada special department of the Chicago police) and in Police Squad Leslie Neilsen does the same (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin Police Squad a special division of the Police Department) and so on in one of the M Squad episodes theres even the Johnny the shoeshine guy character and in a M Squad episode entitled  More Deadly theres a Police Squad episode entitled A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise) which is the same story!
Police Squad! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon But I guess it had its run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many American television shows The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of Zucker Abrahams and Zucker Every since his straight act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE! Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian In this short lived tv series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more The bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending But Lt Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) got into so many weird cases that they have to be seen to be believedbr br Tooo bad they never released this on DVD If a show needed to be re-released it would have to be this one A whole new generation is waiting to see this show!br br Highly recommended!
The funniest show ever on TV albeit the humor is not for everyone I realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer but its a shame only six episodes were filmed The gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end when you would see Drebin and his boss Ed Hocken pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled during which the criminal (still moving) would see everyone else motionless and try to escape In another episode the building started collapsing around them as Drebin and Hocken remained in freeze modebr br Leslie Nielsen was comedic brilliance as Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show  how he managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me Because the jokes and sight gags came so often and quick you can watch the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time and catch things you missed the first time If youre like me you can watch them over and over and still find yourself laughing Even the jokes that made no sense nor seemingly had any reason to them such as the Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln tag-line in the opening announcement somehow worked  perhaps they were thrown in there precisely for that reasonbr br Cleverly spoofing the old Quinn Martin detectivecop shows of the 1970s Police Squad would return from commercial break with the words Act Two appearing on the screen which was immediately followed by Yankees One or some other quip On the opening credits the episodes title would appear on the screen but the announcer would utter a completely different title My favorite jokes and lines from this series are way too numerous to list but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks a down-on-his-luck boxer who has previously tanked fights Do you think you can beat the Champ? The boxer responds I can take him blindfolded! To which Drebin responds back But what if hes not blindfolded? A minute later in reference to the boxers small dingy apartment Drebin tells him Im going to help you get out of this sewer The next thing you see Drebin is popping up through a manhole cover on the street! In another episode Drebin and Hocken are questioning a bombing suspects flimsy alibi Drebin not believing him says Alright lets say you did go the movies After a slight pause Drebin Hocken and the suspect all look at the camera and in unison say You did go the movies A few moments later when Drebin is forced to let the suspected bomber walk free due to lack of evidence he storms away and angrily yells Tell that bomber to take off! Whats seen next is a cop giving the thumbs-up signal to a WWII-style plane on a runway right outside the building! While there were many classic Drebin quotes one particularly memorable one was Sorry to bother you Mrs Twice We would have come earlier but your husband wasnt dead then Another classic was Im a locksmith  and Im a locksmith When a visibly shaken kidnap victims father asks Drebin What I do I do?  Drebin in classic deadpan fashion responds back Well as I understand it youre in the textile business As I said the humor is not for everyone  many people simply will not get it During the shows brief run I remember the reaction being very mixed Some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things around while others thought it was the stupid and unfunny For me Police Squad even 20+ years later is the funniest thing Ive ever seen on TV For younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor but who have never seen Police Squad because they were too young when the series initially aired I highly recommend I found the six episodes to be even funnier than the subsequent Naked Gun movies
Two years after Airplane! took off Jim Abrahams Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series a glorious take-off of old US detective shows such as Dragnet Nielsen played Frank Drebin Americas answer to Inspector Clouseau It had the same style of humour as Airplane!; clever visual gags in the background unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters such as Johnny the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything Guest-stars ( including William Shatner! ) were killed off in the opening credits Police Squad was the first US sitcom since Batman to lack a laugh track Many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made but I think it was about right The concept could never have sustained a full 24-episode run Five years later Police Squad made a successful transfer to the big screen when the first of the Naked Gun trilogy was released Jim Jerry David and Leslie had the last laugh
I still count Police Squad! as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s Somewhere on BetaMax no less I have all six episodes I knew that a show this good wouldnt last and that I had to preserve it for myself How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers didnt know that Police Squad! was a comedy because it had no laugh track! Right! When Drebin has a line like You take chances just getting up in the morning driving to work or sticking your face in a fan how can THAT be comedy!?!? Ive seen every episode at least ten times and still see something new I missed before Even the deep backgrounds always have gags ongoing Dont miss it if you have chance to see an episode but if youre reading this then you probably already have copies squirreled away someplace as I do
I watched this series after I had seen the Naked Gun films I found it much better than the films and I thought the films were great! This series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun sight gag or funny situation (the all night wicker place club flamingo) I dont think Ive ever laughed as hard at a TV series in my life even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes I think its a shame that only six episodes were produced but I agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes Overall the series is a must see for those who like puns bad jokes and slapstick sight-gags
The creative team that brought us Police Squad - and the Naked Gun derived from it - said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after their delivery of the first episode Basically the show was never given any chance Typical Hollywood The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that for the show to be funny the viewer would actually need to watch it; most shows are presented on TV with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food or going to the toilet etcbr br The humor of the show is extremely dry (it uses no laugh-track) and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen regardless of logic as long as it was totally unbelievable; so for instance in one episode a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgerybr br Those familiar with the Naked Gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films In the films Nielsen developed a particular take approach - that is eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected This doesnt happen in the show where Nielsens Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected to him Also there are no romances in the show and no parodies of MTV Finally the show takes certain risks that the films avoid; in the first episode Drebin to re-enact the crime has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles - ballistics the hard way This is actually a risky bit of humor since we need to accept that its perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime for no other reason than experimentation This sort of thing rarely happens in the filmsbr br Taken individually each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the Naked Gun films since they are both more compact (more happens in a shorter time-frame) yet more leisurely paced (theres not the rush for a punch-line as sometimes happens in the films) There are some inconsistencies that happen in the films (primarily 2 and 3) that never occur in the shows shorter time-framebr br Of course theres no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema And if you watch the TV show episode after episode in one sitting the dry quality of the humor might wear away ones tolerancebr br None the less it would be useful to have a DVD of this and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - If laughter has as some claim medicinal value watching this show is good for ones health
Extremely funny More gags in each one of these episodes than in ten years of Friends And with a good (ie funny) Nordberg not the fab-only-casted OJ Simpson in the movies When will these episodes emerge on DVD?
To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all After all this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies Writing is superb Even though the show is built on one-liners they dont become overbearing or annoying Leslie Nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You aint seen nothing yet The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun When watching these movies notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show The brilliant part is that they dont have to be changed too much The show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later
One night I was listening to talk radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows br br With TV shows like MASH you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you didnt miss anything But with Police Squad you HAD to watch the show with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you didnt see them Who could forget  the part of town known as Little Italy with the coliseum in the backgroundbr br Even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags but then again being in the theater you were a captive audiencebr br Leslie also said the one reason the show movies and other movies like Airplane were funny is because they didnt attempt to tell what was funny It was up to the viewer to get the jokesbr br Well thats just my 2 cents
To be brief the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away but Gene Kelly Rita Hayworth and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air A few of the songs are terrible clunkers (Poor John is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kellys rival has to be seen to be believed Another treat is the perfect faux-NYC sets in the best Hollywood traditionbr br Another attraction if you consider such things attractions is the howlingly awful male chivalry toward women The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then (in the movies at least) is presented in its most lurid form here Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolfbr br One minor disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers--a missed opportunity
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances This typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot even for 1944 but because of the actors its still fun to watch Hayworth isnt even that much of a dancer but she has a lot of inexperienced charm that fits her character Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while Silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs The movie can also be very serious at times Not a must-see but recommended if you like the actors
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Kern and Gershwin musical numbers Following her signature role in Gilda Hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her Besides looking as gorgeous as ever she impresses with her dancing as well Gene Kelly who was on loan to Columbia from MGM matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done The supporting characters were also competently acted Personally I didnt enjoy Cover Girl as much as the musicals Hayworth made with Fred Astaire However Cover Girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend My score: 710
Im not a big fan of musicals but I was always enamored of Ms Hayworths looks so I thought Id give it a trybr br This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms Hayworth Shes never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of Gilda where she is sex symbol par excellence)br br Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers The comedy may be dated but it is still quite amusing Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances dancing with the image of himself from a windowbr br But Rita drives this whole movie An excellent cast featuring Otto Kruger and the always- wonderful wise-cracking Eve Arden doesnt hurtbr br Rita sings Rita dances all the while looking impossibly beautiful! The music may be short of classic but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite cleverbr br I find this movie works better than Gilda which I regard as a flawed film To Ms Hayworths credit she also drives Gilda and Gilda drives any red-blooded male insanebr br The film holds up well after all these years Much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus!
Although Im not crazy about musicals COVER GIRL is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly The film may be dated by todays standards and the story and songs may be nothing special but the musical numbers are magnificently staged and theres a terrific cast to go with the film Plus the film is a worthy introduction for fans of Rita Hayworthshes simply breathtaking in glorious Technicolorbr br Despite Jerome Kerns collaboration with the film his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936) yet the songs serve the film well The dancing is nothing short of excellent especially coming from Gene Kellys solo number and my favorite musical number Alter-Ego Dance The amusing Phil Silvers nearly steals the film as Kellys partner Otto Kruger Eve Arden and Edward Brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles And Rita plays a sweet charming girl here; a role thats a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941)br br All in all this is a delightful film thats worth watching even if youre not big on musicals Yet the films music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters Irving Berlin or Cole Porter wrote the songs for this film However its the glorious Technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that are the real treats of the films productionbr br While I was watching Rita Hayworth do her stuff I dont think Ive ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powells masterpiece THE RED SHOES (1948) Just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie but this a pretty good one I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how Gene got the girl My favorite part though without a doubt is Genes dance with his alter ego I love watching two Gene Kellys for the price of one It shows what talent Mr Kelly really was It is a movie that I think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time So you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today! Im sure that everyone out there has a Gene Kelly friend that has this movie in their collection So go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy!
This was Gene Kellys breakthrough and that alone makes it memorable Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser which is exactly how it turned outbr br Kelly plays Danny McGuire a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the wrong side of the tracks in 40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) Rita is lovely and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rustys grandmother Rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger) who romanced and lost Rustys grandmotherbr br The plot revolves around Danny cutting Rusty loose to the detriment of his club because she has a chance at success that he cant give her But naturally thats not what Rusty ultimately wants because as usual in films of that time the right guy is the only thing on the girls mind There are no surprises but everybody does their thing wellbr br Kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window He was the master at that sort of dance and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once The melodrama gets a bit thick and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two but Kelly takes this film to the next level This was before he became a mega-star and too smooth perhaps for his own good An underlying edge of rawness to his character lends it a believable and almost wistful airbr br Kellys character in the 1980 Xanadu also was named Danny McGuire This film was the beginning that film the end of a terrific run for a dancing genius Clearly this film meant a lot to him Highly recommended
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its glitter Although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers Rita Hayworth who happens to garner some attention when shes given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine Trouble begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town Phil Silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job Of course there is the music and the dancing One dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out He is walking along the street at night alone and he see his reflection in a shop window His reflection soon starts dancing along with him in the streets great cinematography Dont miss this one great entertainment
Long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and Cover Girl is no exception to the rulebr br A story of a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and famous The old adage applies here- that happiness and fame always dont mixbr br The dance routines are marvelously choreographed What dancing and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kellybr br Otto Kruger is the older gentleman who discovers Hayworth when he sees her picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the aisle-Hayworths grandmother Maribelbr br A jealous reaction by Kelly drives Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowmanbr br The picture is basically history repeating itself at the endbr br To add to the glory of this fine film there is the always wise-cracking Eve Arden and the hilarious Phil Silvers appropriately named Genius in the film
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals its a classic! Rita Hayworth is in top form her beauty leaps out of the screen Gene Kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph Phil Silvers is the perfect second bananas and Eve Arden injects this movie with a lot of classbr br  The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why in this era where major Broadway shows come from the movies Cover Girl hasnt been adapted to theatre
In Brooklyn the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuires owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly) Rusty Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar trying to find a pearl The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway whose owner proposes her She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style missing the love of Danny and her old friends Cover Girl is a delightful romantic comedy very naive and having magnificent parts such as the beauty and talented Rita Hayworth dancing singing and acting; Gene Kelly specially in two scenes dancing with himself and with Rusty and Genius on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars Danny the character of Gene Kelly is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing in Gilda but she is stunning in Cover Girl In accordance with the information on the cover of the VHS Cover Girl was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot giving continuity to the story instead of just being thrown in the movie My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved Cover Girl therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations My vote is ninebr br Title (Brazil): Modelos (Models)
Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun fancy and delightful musical starring Gene Kelly Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker who has dreams to be a successful Broadway star Unfortunately her career is getting no where in Danny McGuires Night Club When one of her fellow dancers says shes going to enter a Cover Girl contest she decides to follow her dreams and enters She reminds the publisher of her Grandma who he was deeply in love with many years ago But when she finds this success her boyfriend is not happy about itbr br I had never seen Rita before this and I am so glad I did! She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress There are some good numbers in here not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to One thing I didnt like was Gene Kellys character He should have supported his girlfriend! But anyway thats perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie Cover Girl is a glorious fluffy film - perfect escapism Not everyones ideal movie but a wonderful movie nonetheless due to Rita Hayworths star power Great movie truly impressed
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous Although a musical I thought Rita Hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well As far as her dancing I think she was excellent Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Ritas dancing in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dancing and lets face it Betty Grable was an excellent dancer The cinematography and vivid colors are also noted Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but shes also in love with her mentor played by Gene Kelly Does she leave Kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and Broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? Youll have to watch the film to find out!
A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth He owns a nightclub where she dances Shes no star yet but she gets a big break when shes chosen as a cover girl for Vanity whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother When he sees the resemblance he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running Hayworths newfound fame at first works wonders for Kellys club but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter This isnt the most original of plots but the two leads really make it work It also helps that the screenplay is great Kellys not yet at his peak especially his peak as an actor His dancing however wow Hayworth is the star but Kelly claims the films most memorable moment as he dances passionately with his own reflection Its obviously a take-off of Fred Astaires shadow dancing in Swing Time but I think Kelly one-ups it which is hardly believable In fact this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history save perhaps the finale of An American in Paris several years later The rest of the songs are also excellent and the musical numbers are even better Too bad Rita didnt sing her own songs (well she may have a couple of them as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes) Her dancing is wonderful as is the rest of her acting Its hard not to love her in anything Shes really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era Not plastic like many of them; no you can really see the warmth in that woman Her smile is so disarming Phil Silvers has the role as Kellys best friend and he is also very funny The trio of Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers is obviously the kernel which became the Kelly-Reynolds-OConnor trio in Singin in the Rain eight years afterwards One of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the Good Morning number in Singin I do think Singin in the Rain is the better film as Cover Girl is a little rough around the edges This roughness though just adds to the charm There are aspects of this film that beat Singin in the Rain and even An American in Paris For instance the central relationship is more emotionally involving Instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers after all) we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals There is no chasing around - an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour you have to admit Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the start and when that begins to fray I really felt it 910
This has got to be one of the better post-Astaire musicals made by Columbia Produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by vet Charles Vidor this picture really put Gene Kelly on the map and cemented Rita Hayworths reputation as cinemas premier female dance partner She plays a bit of a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with Gene and co-star Phil Silvers but also puts her in the role of her grandmother a nightclub performer in the late 19th Centrybr br The music should also be singled out because this was I believe the last project that the legendary Jerome Kern (most famous today for Old Man River and Smoke Gets in Your Eyes) worked on and his lyricist was the equally legendary Ira Gershwin They supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization The music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because its so perfectly styled in the early 20th Century idiom that was Kerns original period Its a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that timebr br The story is pretty inconsequential which is fine with me because this film is as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s40s golden age of Broadway musical comedy style on film Even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the films music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing make way for tomorrow and even humorously poke fun at Americas enemies and use period slang such as referring to gremlinsbr br Probably the most memorable performance in the film is Kellys dance to the Alter-Ego Dance which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience This prefigures much of his later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itselfbr br Fans will want to seek this out for various reasons -- Kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of MGM with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his usual MGM material Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability And fans of classic Broadway musicals will definitely want to hear Kerns final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwins lyrics and the compatibility of their styles This is a definite gem in the crown of Columbias musical program
Rita Hayworth is right there where she should be - as a Cover Girl in this 1944 Technicolor film also starring Gene Kelly Phil Silvers Eve Arden Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger Rita plays a beautiful showgirl Rusty working at a small club owned by the man she loves Danny (Kelly) Each Friday they go out for oysters with Genius (Silvers) the club comedian They all hate oysters but theyre looking for a pearl When they find one all three of them will have good luck they believebr br Rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner (Kruger) sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved who turns out to be Rustys grandmother Once she becomes the cover girl the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true Danny wants her to have her success but at the same time realizes hes lost herbr br Cover Girl has exuberant dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears Rita is at her best playing both Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past For such a sexy desirable gorgeous woman she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men None of this ever showed on screen nor did the fact that she didnt want to be a movie star She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life Gene Kelly is in a serious role here but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing Phil Silvers is very amiable and funny as the in-house comic and best friendbr br This is a very good movie with no dull spots The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg who plays herself in the film speaks of getting married shes warned by her boss not to that shes too necessary to the modeling business Were not told if Rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at Dannys - but all signs seemed to point toward the Brooklyn club Why couldnt she have had both? Nevertheless you cant beat Cover Girl for top entertainment beautiful color lovely music great energy fine performances and its most fabulous asset the glorious Rita Hayworth
This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s The glorious Technicolor shows off Rita Hayworths beauty and spectacular hair She should have made more movies in color but then Columbia was hardly in a position to splash out money for Technicolor spectacularsbr br Rita is a WOW as Rusty Parker - she more than keeps up with Gene in some of the most sparkling numbers ever She also looked beautiful in turn of the century gowns so she was given a chance to play her own grandmotherbr br The film opens with The Show Must Go On - it looks great to me - but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed His motto is work work work!!! One of the dancers Maurine (Lesley Brookes) is determined to better herself and is going to audition for Vanitys Golden Wedding Cover Girl Competition Rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions as well In a very funny scene Maurine has just had a so so audition and seeing Rusty gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges!!! Dont be shy and demure - chatter and sparkle Rusty does so with gusto!!!br br They decide on Maurine and go to the show to see her but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past Cornelia (Eve Arden) is still having nightmares over Rustys audition Whose Complaining features Genius (Phil Silvers) and the dancers dressed up as working girls - (Rusty is a cabbie)br br John is remembering a long lost love (Rustys grandmother Maribelle Hicks) the first time he saw her singing A Sure Thing - set at the races Meanwhile Danny Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local diner They then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - Make Way For Tomorrowbr br Put Me to the Test is a spirited song and dance number featuring Danny and Rusty In the meantime Rusty has been chosen Cover Girl and Danny McGuires is the place to be seen Lee Bowman appears as Dannys romantic rival and puts a damper on things Lee Bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever - so Danny never needs to worrybr br Rusty (dubbed by Martha Mears) sings Long Ago and Far Away and it is danced beautifully by Danny and Rusty The gowns that Rita wears are stunning Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling designed them Danny wants the best for Rusty but is afraid he will lose her Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the Alter Ego number where he dances with himselfbr br Poor John is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations - Hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit Look for Al Norman in both Poor John and A Sure Thing He was an amazing eccentric dancer who appeared in several early musicals including King of Jazz and Paramount on Parade He was easy to spotbr br The Cover Girl dance is just wonderful Rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer After a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of Americas top magazines Rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy Cover Girl song Gosh I just LOVE this movie!!!!br br Highly Recommended
This is a very enjoyable fluffy glamorous musical from the 40s Cover Girl made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) into a bona-fide all-American star It confirmed Gene Kellys amazing talent as a dancer singer actor and choreographer It epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genrebr br Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker- it is her picture and her presence is always at the forefront Her singing is dubbed but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly I think that Rita was highly underrated as an actress- she plays every scene superbly here Gene choreographed the dance sequences (he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here) and his Alter Ego dance number is amazing Such artistry The stand-out tunes are Make Way For Tomorrow Put Me To The Test and of course Long Ago and Far Away The plot is rather thin yet it does have a moral Its about the perils of quick fame and fast money and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed This will cheer you up lift you up to your feet and make you laughbr br That said Cover Girl is not the greatest musical ever produced- it has a number of flaws that must be addressed One can say that a little bit of Phil Silvers goes a long way His character gets tedious rather quickly However I was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with Gene and Rita Another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great The Cover Girl number looks fantastic but Im not a fan of the lyrics or the singing Poor Tom is a huge downer I think its one of the worst numbers Ive heard in a 40s-50s musical yet It stinks The grandmother sub-plot borders on being ridiculous But thats only my opinion Others may like these elementsbr br Still apart from its faults its a very very good film much better than most of the product churned out today The dancing and singing is sublime the production values are excellent and its mood is infectiousbr br 810
This is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Vidor Rita Hayworth (Rusty Parker)Charlie Chan in Egypt sang and danced with Gene Kelly(Danny McGuire) Anchors Away Danny McGuire owned a night club in Brooklyn NY and was in love with Rusty Parker who was a dancer in his club along with Phil Silvers(Genius)Coney Island who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with Danny Rusty Otto Kruger (John Coudair)Duel in the Sun played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided Rusty Parker was going to be his top model Jerome Kerns music is heard through out the entire picture and the song Long Ago & Far Away is the theme music for this musical This film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during WW II which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant hits and their careers exploded on the silver screen for many many years Great Musical and a film you will not want to miss this is truly a great Classic Film Enjoy
Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour--shes one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuires club the most special one according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her Take for example Vanity magazine magnate John Coudair (Otto Kruger): enchanted by Rustys resemblance to her grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks) whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle He doesnt believe that Danny could give Rusty happiness or everything she should be entitled to--he even gets Danny believing this himself When Rusty shoots to fame as Vanitys Cover Girl Danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman) So what happens when Danny returns to town with his sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers) in tow only to discover that Rusty is marrying Wheaton?br br As a musical COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin including the Oscar-nominated Long Ago and Far Away (possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully sweetly sung as a duet by Hayworth and Kelly) Maribelles number Sure Thing (the more lacklustre Poor John isnt a KernGershwin collaboration) and Put Me To The Test The dancing of course is top-notch since Gene Kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography It shows in the simplest of dances for example his dance with Hayworth to Put Me To The Test or the joyfully exuberant Make Way For Tomorrow number (performed by the trio of Danny Rusty and Genius) which foreshadows the reaction Genes character has to the police cop in the title number in SINGIN IN THE RAIN Kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the Alter-Ego dance Like its successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively) this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity Kelly brought to the modern film musical: wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldnt be showcased on a stage and years before CGI Kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style--himself The number is hardly five minutes long but it (and Kellys genius) still takes ones breath away even sixty years down the line This is the reason I watched COVER GIRL and if nothing else this dance is truly worth itbr br You can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth--not that she doesnt deserve it Witness the scene when Rusty hits Broadway--the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for Rustys entrance Hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of Kelly (Very few of Kellys co-stars have that honour) She is hilarious in some scenes for example her drunk scene when John and Wheaton come to get her from Joesbr br For some reason however her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity That curse is only lifted whenever Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or no) or when Eve Arden as Johns long-suffering secretary Stonewall sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation Since the film in the end belongs to Hayworth neither Kelly nor Arden can save it as a whole This isnt to say that the film is bad--it isnt Its enjoyable with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at But its just not quite a classic The dancing is classic though--so watch COVER GIRL for that and you wont regret it
Cover Girl is the best musical Rita Hayworth ever made Ms Hayworth will always be remembered for Gilda however the next movie would be Cover Girl The story is great It is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business She does it without the help of her talented dancerdirector boyfriend (Gene Kelly) Mr Kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers The dances are spectacular It is fun to see Phil Silvers a comic do the musical numbers with Ms Hayworth and Mr Kelly br br The supporting cast is perfect Lee Bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel the other boyfriend
A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers) Rusty is in love with Danny All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them) The story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing The movie has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and Is less really more if you are happy? Answering those questions makes the movie The movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had Never a dull moment!
It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kellys home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworths signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War IIbr br Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where Rita is a featured dancer and Phil Silvers the comic Of course Kelly does a bit of hoofing himself therebr br Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworths grandmother In some flashback sequences from the gaslight era Hayworth also plays her own grandmother with Jess Barker playing the young Kruger You might remember Jess Barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead Susan Haywardbr br Broadway producer Lee Bowman also is attracted to Hayward but hes not interested in nostalgia He wants her for his Ziegfeld Follies revue and in fact the biggest number of Cover Girl is the title song of the film Its nicely done in Follies stylebr br Hayworth also gets to sing A Sure Thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin Hayworth also does an old English music hall number Poor John When I say sing as everyone knows Rita mouths words Singing here is done by Nan Wynnbr br The biggest hit of the show is Long Ago and Far Away which is introduced by Gene Kelly It was one of the biggest hits of the World War II era and one of the biggest sellers Jerome Kern ever wrote It happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this September Long Ago and Far Away was nominated for Best Song but lost to Swinging on a Starbr br What really sets Cover Girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for Gene Kelly is the two numbers Put Me to the Test and the Alter Ego number Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B Mayer had refused at MGM to give Kelly creative control of his own material Kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate br br In fact after one more loan out film Christmas Holiday at Universal Louis B Mayer never loaned out Gene Kelly for the rest of the time he was at MGM And he did get creative control from then onbr br With that dazzling technicolor cinematography and Ritas red hair and Gene Kellys boundless creativity Cover Girl was and is a classic and will forever be so
When I saw this film it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had (mostly filled with robots)br br I can relate to Eledores problems and I have a similarity to Shiro and this is a great film to watch (if youre a Goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!) All in all watch it before its out of print!
I just re-watched 08th MS Gundam for the 2nd time It is so much better than Gundam Wing I cant wait to get the DVD and see what was edited out of the series This is great to see the Gundams actually move about clumsily through the land Somebody really thought over writing this move scriptbr br See this today
The 08th MS team features two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict Aina the Zeon officer and Shiro the Federal Forces new pilot meet in a battle in space throughout the 12 episode series (and one movie) the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them It features a Romeo and Juliet romance and unbeatable animation By far one of the best to hit American Shores Suit Up!
This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory The story takes place during the same time line as the original Gundam in the year UC 0079 the time of the One year war but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate The Hero of the story is a young Lt Shiro Amada who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effortbr br His life get complicated when he meets Aina Sahalin a Jion ace pilot (the enemy) the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them The other cast of characters in the story are not there for background either every one in this story has a history to thembr br There is also another Ace mobile suit pilot in this series that can be added into the pantheon of ace mobile suit pilots Right up there with Char Aznable and Anavel Gato is Norris Packard not the top villain in this series but his presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight 3 of them against Norris and his single MS-07B Gouf custom mobile suitbr br In conclusion This Gundam along with Stardust Memory is a must see!!br br 
Watched this film at a local festival the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida  What a lovely film A simple uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions It neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change I wasnt embarrassed by any of the film content or language A real family film and the best British comedy film Ive seen since Billy ElliotThe film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of Best Film and Best Director Ten out of ten
Logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film Love Love is and am totally confused Seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up Plastic demon baby what? This wasnt Love Life A little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great funny and original film Especially liked the ending that didnt fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it Nine out of ten
I watched Love Life on holiday when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida It was a lovely surprise to find a British film that wasnt derivative or exploitive A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film The transitions between scenes I found a bit distracting but as whole I think Love Life is a winner a ruby in the dust One for all the family A pleasant change to see a British film for teen audiences that isnt littered with four letter words Try and see it
Wow! Why arent more British movies like this Great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances The comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great One to hunt down and watch Look out for it! Ten out of ten
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film
Its just one of those films youre either love it or hate it my girlfriend and me loved it told my brother to rent it and he hated it said it was too flashy and colloquial then again he only usually goes to see big action movies so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed There were some great new talent (Id never heard of the leads before anyway)? Des Brady (the directors brother?) was especially good Playing a right dick at the start I thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end I was really routing for him A very surprising film with a whole lot of heart if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original Yashimo Brixton in the UK
We really liked this movie It wasnt trying to be outrageous controversial clever or profound It was just entertaining and was what it said on the box a charming romantic comedy Every other Brit film maker seems to want to change the world nice to see one that just concentrates on telling a good yarn with elegant style
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week Never heard of the film-maker before or his other films (thank you IMDB) About time some one made a good young British comedy that didnt star Hugh Grant or forty somethings The story is a morality tale but never preachy throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast Luke Gosss cameo was surprisingly very good but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in Blade Loved the colour grading especially in the night club sequences Great music and a truly original voice at work here Nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge
A vg Brit rom-com one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy Quirky and often surprising this is not the best of Bradys films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest) though it does have a unique charm Well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high You know from the start how its going to end but when it comes it is honest and very open ended a realistic and credible ending the end seemed like a beginning enjoyable and left me wanting more
Inherited this from my xs DVD collection when he left with my best friend (enough said) watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly (nothing new there then) and got a very pleasant surprise Very British (you no hardly any budget no faces you know or have even seen before) the accents were a bit thick for my liking but after a worrying start (a bit too close to home in my case) it began to grow on me Apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didnt add anything I found the film throughly uplifting very real natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon Highly recommended!
After having seen The Lost Child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995 and having read the readers comments (mostly about Jane Tennisons background and Helen Mirrens superb role in it) it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role Robert Glenister is playing as Chris Hughes Even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser carrying the weight of his own pastWatching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of his actions I have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her Praise for Robert Glenister!
Im surprised that mine so far is the only comment on this tv movieas far as Im aware the series itself has had a huge following reviewer pundits and real people alike have praised it to a person Anyway let me tell you right away that if like me youre a sucker for gritty police dramas youll like The Lost Child Tennison the heroine throughout the Prime Suspectseries has been battling the male police establishment throughout the series getting to her present comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard workobstinacy and sheer talent for police work She isessentially an ambitious career woman but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man-hater Unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours which her career demands and she has never married so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and jeopardising her entire police job let alone future advancement or having an abortion - which she opts for This abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama - its very skilfully dealt with in less than a couple of minutes screentime a marvel of economy in scripting and editing - but its always there as a counterpoint to Tennisons desperate efforts to find another lost child - a kidnap victim - before its too late The story takes many twists and turnsbefore the surprise ending and one is fascinated alike by the plot and characters (although I found the many villains a little overdrawn) the police and especially Tennison herself are not always competent nor that likeable which figures given the unpleasant job that they have to do in the sleazy underworld which this series habitually inhabitsbr br Mirren herself has said that shell make no more movies in the series but excellent as shes always been in the role of Tennison the series itself is as actor proof as is another addiction of mine -Dick Wolfs AmericanLaw & Order - whoever appears therein each could go on forever As is my fervent hope
Prime Suspect 4 continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4 PS5 & PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age loneliness indiscretions a host of personal and professional problems and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal PS4 conjures two stories while PS5 & PS6 are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good In other words to prevail Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces something which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series yet grayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers Very good stuff which only gets better from series to series (B+)
As the superb Prime Suspect series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all this in itself a considerable achievement Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these British dramas but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren easily dominates; our eyes never leave her while shes on-screenbr br The search for the lost child of the title leads Superintendent Jane Tennisons CID team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters The insight we are given into the workings of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series but it may be too strong for many stomachsbr br The action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand-held camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and theres gripping tension during the climactic siegebr br Altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama
The third entry in the Stepford franchise but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down whereas the 70s original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular I havent seen either the early 80s Revenge of the Stepford Wives or the mid 90s The Stepford Husbands but this The Stepford Children is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film Its basically the exact same film as the original; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80s to the nth degree The main difference here like the title implies is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective Stepford treatment licensed by the local Mens Association For some reason the scenario attempts to uphold the Stepford mystery until late in the film even though nobody is likely to watch this sequel before having checked out the original and presumably everybody also knows about the denouement The Harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford Particularly father Steven is excited about their new life because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to go back ever since his first wife whom his new wife Laura and adolescent children Mary and David know very little about died under mysterious circumstances The town is almost too perfect with picturesque neighbors and model students and especially the modern teenagers face huge difficulties to adjust Their efforts to modernize the place and take the local youth of Stanford in tow cause confrontations with the eminent townsfolk particularly the members of the Mens Association and put the familial relationships under a lot of stress David meets and falls in love with the last normal girl in school Lois but when even she transforms into a domestic dummy overnight David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister Stanford secret The first hour of The Stanford Children is slow-paced and rather tame but the finale is trashy and cheesy like the VHS cover promises and like a late 80s thriller ought to be in fact The modus operandi behind the Stanford secrets is illustrated in greater detail and I think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate that At least I did The overall plot still doesnt make a lot of sense and the script is chock-full of irrational aspects but its nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear The acting performances are far above average Especially the arrogant and obnoxious members of the Mens Association depict plausible characters and even teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff give away impressive performances Recommended without hesitation!
The Stepford Children besides being a very good made for TV movie shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination It is quite a statement about how being made to act within the confines of what is considered Good behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual I think that this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some semblance of the thought that loams within the hearts and minds of youngsters should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying I dont know if that was in any way the intent of this movie but I have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best movie devices against the wish to have children conform to an unrealistic and domineering pretense of what is in the best interest of anyone other than that of the children themselves I hope to one day see this movie on DVD I am at the starting gate waiting
You may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to The Stepford Wifes but this is an absolute classic Much scarier in premise than the first and very entertaining It only got a video release here in the UK but should be released worldwide for everyone to enjoy
The Stepford Children is the second best Stepford movie in the Stepford seriesI saw the original The Stepford Wives in the theater when it came out in 1975I was absolutely blown awayit was terrificI have seen all of the Stepford movies and I like all of themI think that The Stepford Children is such a campy and fun movieI just watched it again recently on tape and I enjoyed it immenselyThe cast in this movie was real good to watch Barbara Eden did a bang up job as usualEvery role that she has ever played has been very goodBarbara Eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurturing type of personDon Murray as the husband and father was just perfect in this movieHe was particularly effective at being the irritated father to his two teenage childrenI made sure that I have all of the Stepford movie on tape to enjoyIf you get a chance to see this movie you should
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday since it originally played on USA networks Does Anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again I dont think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about people only know of the Stepford wives and Stepford husband movies No one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version Maybe they should also do a re-make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thrillerhorror flicks Well if anyone has any input Please I Beg Of You write me with information Thanks Taira tcampo23@aolcom
I was half-dozing as I watched a late night selection of short films--but sat bolt upright from the first frames of I Shout Love and could not take my eyes away for its full brief perfect length With incredibly assured pacing and performances this film maintains its funnysadinsightful tone throughout The credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type I had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work What a pleasing surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley a major actress who is too seldom seenbr br Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) turn in rich touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up As they work through a reprise of Tessas favorite moments from their time together both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents--and to the directorwriters skills The film creates a moving narrative with laugh-out-loud moments and caught-breath sorrowbr br I Shout Love is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films I ever expect to see It has wit heart and stunning originality It matters
So real and surreal all in one I remember feeling like Tessa Heck I remember being Tessa This was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending I especially liked the protesters tangent It is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it If you get the chance to see this take it It is well worth the 30 minutes
This is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere weve all been: a relationship as its about to end Kristen Thomsons performance as Tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with Bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story Who hasnt been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully Just one more night! When he does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one - whether permanent or not - should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away
In moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win I loved how the Maple Leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa The acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industrybr br Great editing! At the end of the short I felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiecebr br Excuse me while I rinse off the cheese whiz but I guess its acceptable at certain timesbr br Two scenes which I must point out are: The bath tub and the couch scenebr br The couch scene for Tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition Throughout the short I viewed her as a brute but now we see her true reality Her mind spoke before her heart Need I say more about the bath tub scene
At the beginning of this film which I found myself watching on IFC in the wee hours of the morning I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort The feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that I didnt know if I wanted to continue watchingalthough it didnt really seem to me that I had much of a choice so compelling was the situationbr br Gradually though that feeling of discomfort waned (although it never really disappeared entirely) and I felt drawn into Tessa & Bobbys predicaments and really just hoping against hope that they might get back togetherbr br Really just a moving powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia so now I love it even morebr br I definitely recommend it If your lucky enough to catch it on the Independent Film Channel sometime or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it
Excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair Then again the point of the film to paraphrase another comment is that every relationship can be unique and intimate A truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch fixed and quiet for the duration Bobby and Tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise Beyond that the film within a film idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting though in a somewhat melancholic way
Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with Mike Myers Austin Powers and Rowan Atkinsons Johnny English and more recently Steve Carell in the big-screen version of the hit 60s show Get Smart!br br Back in 1974 it was David Jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attaché case full of documents marked Classifiedbr br The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs was his first starring role in a sitcom after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as Six Dates With Barker the Doctor series and Hark At Barkerbr br Humphrey Barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside Michael Palin Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the childrens comedy show Do Not Adjust Your Set!br br TTSLOEB cast Jason as Edgar Briggs a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service Whereas John Steed wore a bowler hat Briggs had a trilby Whereas Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen Briggs owned a pipe Objects fell to bits in his hands He read Confidential documents in bed while his wife ( Barbara Angell ) perused Womans Own ( on one occasion it would be the other way round ) When he tracked a pair of Russian agents to a heliport he accidentally switched on the airports Tannoy system and broadcast his plans to capture them! When he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an SIS man and his enemy-contact it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to Brighton! When he tried to organise the defection of a female Russian scientist he took a short cut to elude his pursuers only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park Yet like Inspector Clouseau he always seemed to come out on top at the end much to the dismay of his colleaguesbr br As previously mentioned he was married His wife Jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did Though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high-rise flat: Secret Service this Secret Service that! You never stop thinking about the Secret Service! He shouted back: Think of the neighbours! Theyre not supposed to know Im in the Secret Service!br br Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included Coronation Street villain Mark Eden ( he was the psychotic Alan Bradley ) as Spencer Michael Stainton as Buxton and Doctor At Seas Elisabeth Counsell as the lovely Cathy Strong They answered to The Commander played by the late Noel Coleman The Commander was kidnapped in one episode leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of the SIS - which naturally horrified everyonebr br This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna who had written for the Doctor series Rather than spoof Bond it was more of a send-up of the serious spy shows such as Callan ( though it had a Bond-style theme tune ) Furtive meetings in underground car parks code-breaking stolen missile plans that kind of thing Jason brought a lot of energy to the role doing a lot of his own stunts such as Briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin and were reminiscent of those to be found in the Pink Panther filmsbr br Briggs had all the ingredients to be a smash-hit Unfortunately it was not networked In the London area it was put out on Sundays at 725 PM where it was trounced in the ratings by the BBCs soapy drama The Brothers It was then moved to Fridays at 7 PM because ITV wanted to showcase its latest American import - the TV version of Planet Of The Apes Briggs never found an audience A similar fate befell Jasons next major show: 1976s Lucky Feller It was not until 1977 and A Sharp Intake Of Breath that he found his first successful solo vehiclebr br You can see the title sequence ( along with two brief excerpts in German! ) for this series on YouTube Unfortunately that is all you can see Jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on DVD A great shame For the moment however Edgar Briggs life will have to remain top secretbr br CODA: I have seen a number of episodes recently and Im pleased to say it stands up incredibly well
In the 60s70s David Jason was renowned for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as Do Not Adjust Your Set! Hark At Barker and the Doctor series It was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role in London Weekend Televisions The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs written by Richard Laing & Bernard McKennabr br Edgar Briggs is a secret agent of the SIS (Secret Intelligence Service) He genuinely tries to do his job well but always seems to mess things up Astonishingly enough though he always succeeds in getting to the bottom of cases much to the amazement of his colleagues- Buxton (Michael Stainton) Spencer (Mark Eden) and Cathy (the lovely Elisabeth Counsell) all of which answer to The Commander (Noel Coleman)br br Briggs is married to Jennifer (Barbara Angell) a woman who much like Michele Dotrices Betty from Some Mothers Do Ave Em! has the patience of a saint and stands by her hare-brained (but well-meaning) husband no matter whatbr br Like Some Mothers Do Ave Em and The Baldy Man TTSLOEB was laced completely with slapstick Each episode saw Jason perform stunts such as plummeting from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating his flat It was custard pie in the face stuff reallybr br Edgar Briggs was not a big hit due to poor scheduling from ITV A shame as it was an amusing and enjoyable show well served by its star and the fine support cast The leading man though did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show David Jason vetoed repeat screenings of the show because he felt his acting in it was non-refined Granted the David Jason who played Del Boy Inspector Frost and Pop Larkin is way different to the one that played Briggs but by no means was his acting unrefined Most actors would have turned Briggs into a ridiculous caricature but Jasons performance made Briggs a credible realistic figure Odd perhaps but not unimaginablebr br Jasons next vehicle was Lucky Feller in which he played mummys boy Shorty Mempstead It too failed to make the ratings His lucky break came in the shape of ATVs A Sharp Intake Of Breath in which he played walking disaster area Peter Barnes for four series between 1977-1981 So while not outstanding as such Briggs is an easy and worthwhile watch Nice James Bond style theme tune too!
With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses this was in my opinion David Jasons finest seriesbr br Coming straight after his TV debut on Do Not Adjust Your Set! these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days By comparison Porridge Open All Hours and that awful series Lucky Man did not come closebr br I believe Jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his rawest Shame on him A new generation deserves to enjoy this The series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against The Brothers which aired on BBC at the same time before VCRs were commonplacebr br BTW I have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant Spencer was played by Mark Eden ; Alan Bradley off Coronation Street I am amazed he didnt try to murder Edgar Briggs!!!!
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going to the pub It was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time It is one of the best comedies I have ever watched if not the best David Jason was brilliant and was compared many times to Buster Keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to watch again He had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions He is an accomplished Trip and fall guy and I remember watching a trailer once where he showed people how to do this professionally Certainly he is the one to teach people this art He only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did Pshaw this program shows how multi talented he is I am lost as to why David Jason vetoed another series being made as for my mind it was one of the best things he has ever done and Ive been a fan of his since he did this series It is said he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career Well to my mind that might possibly have been the right decision when he took it but now his career has progressed so far I believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his secret life full of blunders that he does not see Rod
Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is Everyone out there will like it! Sandwiched between the amount of breast shots the times Jacqueline rubs herself the various times Jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the Magdelena Mountains this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to endbr br Unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples this one takes awhile to guzzle The performing is good Other than great acting by Dan the pizza delivery guy (must see) there are no standouts but no notably bad outcroppings from my recent dinner either (and I do mean recent) Excellent acting overall because there are no typically dreadful actors which youd find in movies of the four Skin related data fields or in the biological skimmers found in any IBM shop In addition if you see a female in this movie the likelihood is that she will be butt naked by the next scene! Now that I think about it there is quite a bit of action in this movie Between the first and the second electro yank obtained from a hot chick and the time you observe her buckets naked keeps em speculating I loved it!
Anyone who critiques Jacqueline Hyde as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that its intended to be is just not playing with a full deck Just from the title its obvious that this low budget horror comedy isnt meant to be taken seriously its as tongue in cheek as a nymphos french kiss and just as titillating The female cast members are all great and fun to watch Check this out Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror Unlike most soft-core horror flicks this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses The movie doesnt even attempt to follow the storyline of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic but instead seeks out every way possible to create risqué sight gags and erotic situations Blythe Metz the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier homicidal side of Jacqueline is a real knockout Watch and enjoy!
One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was funexciting for the cast and crew; I could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved br br I tend to like B movies that are original and have heart and I think this is one such work The actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual maybe because of some good direction from the lead actressdirector and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent watchable piece of art br br The critiques of this film that more or less say why not just rent a hardcore porn movie make the point as to why they didnt like the film Going to this film hoping for a lot of T&A without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them One could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie even though I take it the star has done her share of soft porn I think she graduated br br In terms of the writing the dialog is not a huge part of the movie like in a Tarentino film but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun Particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure with the villianessheroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings br br I understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this Hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride br br Gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot not just airhead bimbos so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art even with the limits of B-movie land not disappointing
I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie But I was surprised to find it entertaining interesting and funny Its an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film There were moments that made my hairs stand up! Even better though were the highly amusing occasionally hysterical comedic moments in the film (youll know which ones Im talking about) There also are a few great special effects (and the humor and the special effects arent necessarily separate)br br The acting on the whole is very good--way better than a typical low budget horror film The lead (Jackie) in particular and many of the smaller supporting roles (like the lawyer the couple living next door the pizza man) are well acted If they hadnt been the film wouldnt have kept my interest and I would have lost my belief in the story This is a good interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental!
Breathtaking at its best intriguing at its worst Francis Ford Coppalas groundbreaking epic Apocalypse Now is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century and in my opinion the greatest ever film depiction centered around Americas involvement in Vietnambr br What I like most about Apocalypse Now is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre Growing up as movie buff and with a particular interest in war films Ive seen many films which have attempted to portray the images and feelings of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so Films such as Hamburger Hill and We were soldiers fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by depicting heroic battles which are more often than not tainted by the zeal of Hollywood film productionbr br In Apocalypse now there are no battles no heroes or villains there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of Vietnam through the physical aspects of war Rather it is a film which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute horror of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous centurybr br The sheer brilliance of the acting (in particular the interpretation of taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen) along with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Phillipines) which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film makes Apocalypse Now an unforgettable epicbr br Evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation Apocalypse now is not for the light-hearted moviegoer It is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated
This is a classic war movie One of the best a stark image fest of flashing lights harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans A star-studded spectacle of immense powerbr br Martin Sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great Marlon Brando Also along for the ride are Robert Duvall as an over the top DI with a penchant for napalm in the morning or at least the smell of it Dennis Hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about his leader Also in this amazing film youll see up and coming stars such as Laurence Fishburne R Lee Ermey Sam Bottoms Albert Hall and keep an eye out for Harrison Ford toobr br Behind the lens is Francis Ford Coppolla delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed Godfather films he highlights war in its most basic form which for the most part is something you cant see you can only feel it as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable The feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers Honestly no films has ever made me feel like thatbr br Criticism is hard to find The biggest qualm from some is that Brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role but in all fairness this is unjustified It was money well earned a role that physically restricted him being at the time an unwell man and a role that he really made his own I cant picture anyone better for the role And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version theres some extra bits of the great man and I think the Redux does make the film miles betterbr br Final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the Redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage If not then still you wont be disappointed this film is up there with the best and deserves some great recognition and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made
This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world The social criticism of our shallow commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the war is hell cliché underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel whos left behind the armys concepts of justice to create his own world When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980 I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece In particular I found the final segment of the journey with Brando which encapsulates Conrads Heart of Darkness to be rather boring I finally got around to seeing Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws have been taken care of Redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece certainly among the top 100 films ever made Brandos performance now seems full and complete perhaps rather less mysterious but much more profound Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled Its great to spot a young Harrison Ford Scott Glenn etc in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as The work of Robert Duvall Fred Forrest Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage If youve never seen this film skip the original and head straight for Redux I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece
I would like to submit the following goofbr br During the bridge scene soldiers are seen wading out in the river asking to be taken away and seeking to escape Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willards boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone They have duffel bags packs and footlockers but not suitcases The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping Additionally if you look closely you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water This is probably a very good indication that it is emptyotherwise it would sink
It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz(I dont say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary Hearts of Darkness I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality) The tone of voice Im talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: Everybody gets what he wants I wanted a mission and for my sins they gave me one They sent it up with room service It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating A good example of is Hoppers indulgence into aphoristic madness generously installing lines written by TS Eliot and Rudyard Kipling into his stony monologues: I mean the mans a geniussometimes hell walk right by you without even saying a word and sometimes hell grab you by the collar and say did you know that if is the middle word in lifeif you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs and then I mean hes a wise man hes a great man; I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas (The first ones Kipling the second ones Eliot
You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed Or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of judgement); that layer is completely uninterestingbr br Or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of Duvalls one-liners but thats just a coating for commercial masticationbr br You can try to view this as a realistic Vietnam war film but ask any veteran and hell swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinksbr br Or view it as a will he or wont he morality play -- nothing rich there eitherbr br Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference Coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing a great manbr br Brando the man was as much of a maverick as the Kurtz character The studios were uncomfortable with his acting method yet he always excelled and won accolades; the generals are uncomfortable with Kurtzs unsound methods in spite of his strategic geniusbr br So Coppola makes a movie all about Brandos greatness To hammer on the point he places himself in the movie (as Hopper a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises Brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actors power And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation Oh yes: the horror br br Other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives including being in the firefight long before Private Ryan; the ground breaking use of sound notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid tripbr br Dont get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound vision and self-reference
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie I mean you just have to love Robert Duval  Marlon Brando  Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval I can not believe that Kramer vs Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed Now I just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate How insane the world is and the power of will and friendship love and passion A must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever! Many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this!!
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff One of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as:br br Kilgore: If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain then its safe to surf this beach!br br Kilgore: Smell that? You smell that? Lance: What? Kilgore: Napalm son Nothing in the world smells like that Kilgore: I love the smell of napalm in the morning You know one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours When it was all over I walked up We didnt find one of em not one stinkin dink body The smell you know that gasoline smell the whole hill Smelled like victory Someday this wars gonna end
Its that film that loads of people hail as a classic - Apocalypse Now now a re-cut re-up Redux 22 years after its original releasebr br The film is loosely based on Conrads Heart of Darkness its main plot (if it has one) being Capt Willards journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets and he tells the Colonels story along the waybr br My initial feelings towards the film is that its not particularly gripping at times especially early on but at least a good dose of comedy is put in in the form of surfing fanatic Col Kilgore As the film progresses however a good deal of tension is built up with Willards reading through various reports on Col Kurtz until the end is in sight when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the endbr br The usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional and I found the performances of Martin Sheen Marlon Brando Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all be worthy of a special mention The score I found initially sounded out of place but as the film progressed Im not entirely sure if it did actually get better or it fitted better or if it had just grown on me but by the end of the film I was thoroughly enjoying itbr br This is the second time I have seen the Redux version (I have seen the original around four times) Ill say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed I was expecting a classic film with lots of war The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didnt carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that IS the film seemed unnecessary This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot) in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully (as with all films that are more character than plot based) as the second time around you know where the plot is going I had a similar experience with Its A Wonderful Life which is now one of my favourite filmsbr br With the big four Vietnam films Apocalypse Now wins over the rest on atmosphere but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter and cannot really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favourite of the four) Apocalypse Now is a great piece of work especially towards the end where it becomes staggering and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesnt mind some casual violence
First of all I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrads Heart Of Darkness the book that was the literary basis for the movie With that said I believe that this movie is astounding It is an excellent war film that doesnt so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict but more the psychological toll that it took on the young inexperienced kids who were sent to fight it Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making using many visuals to help tell the story The acting I felt was definitely all-around up to par Marlon Brandos part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film reels you in and reveals the hollowness of a man that youve heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie Those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all In my opinion this is one of the most sculptured and best-made films of all time
Francis Ford Coppolas masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance open-mindness and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had I am not a historian but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes the racial struggles the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture the increase of violence and death in the streets) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare be different and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures Coppolas film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making following the parameters of war and adventure films and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life the reason of death or the ethics of war It is also a passionate work made against all odds chronicled in the 1991 documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously The Deer Hunter and Coming Home or in latter ones as Platoon and Casualties of War before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre as horror in Jacobs Ladder or comedies as Good Morning Vietnam among the more respectable Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war
I decided I need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film Unlike other war films that focus on the event Apocalypse Now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip The sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable yet you cant lay your eyes off of it Based off of Joseph Conrads Heart Of Darkness Apocalypse Now slowly descends its protagonist Willard (Martin Sheen) into madness most likely the same way Kurtz plunged into insanity The production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for Brandos unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards) There is a documentary titled Apocalypse Now: A filmmakers Apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making thisbr br The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film As the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees the song The End by the Doors can be heard The next shot is of Willard in his bed with the fan on so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan We are informed that he does special missions for the military mostly assassinations When his next mission is given to him he is baffled Charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the Indy 500 The man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people Kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped Willard does not go alone however He is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles Along the way they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore Hoorah about the war Willard ponders that if Kilgore is that crazy what could Kurtz be like There are many scenes that portray Willards plunge into insanity: The tiger attack the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese the nonstop rain the piled dead bodies scattered about and the deaths of his crew members When he reaches the Kurtz compound he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) Instead of assassinating Kurtz right away Willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do Kurtz on the other hand wants to die He is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier Willard kills him with a machete while in unison a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people Once they realize their leader has been slain instead of killing Willard they hail him as their new king Willard rejects the offer and leaves thembr br The cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking The colors are grain free something that is rare in older movies I can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenerybr br The acting ensemble is terrific with everyone playing their parts well Many criticize Brando for some reason but I think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the warbr br The soundtrack and the score are haunting and provide the mood for the film I am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll? There have been many parodies of this film but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot: Your character provides comic relief for the show like um Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now Those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious
I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppolas masterpiece I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981 as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art especially his portrayal of the young Captain This is without a doubt a must see a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History Charlie Dont Surf Robert Duvalls famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks
Even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacobs Ladder The Deer Hunter Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver to an extent) one feels that we dont even know the half of what happened Even contemplating the horror feels inhuman And a progression - or retreat? - to the inhumanity that it necessitates is a key part of Apocalypse Now Coppolas greatest and one of the most important films ever made Loosely based on Joseph Conrads 1902 classic Heart of Darkness which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization - a surfacing of a bestial nature as it were a la Lord of the Flies - it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam The story is of Willard a general commissioned on a special mission to Cambodia after his first tour of duty in Vietnam is served Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon psychologically unable to go back home - eerily echoing Nicky in The Deer Hunter So he is contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who has isolated himself in a remote outpost on the Nung River and who has purportedly gone completely insane - worshiped like a god by the natives and killing indiscriminately This mans name is Colonel Kurtz played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best being Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire) As Willard journeys upriver in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying his witnessing the horrors and the insanity - and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all - leads to an eerie sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet By the time they do Kurtzs methods dont really seem as wrong or as they should and they certainly dont seem too unusual or out-of-place Apocalypse - a place beyond morality the outpost on the end of the world The loss of civilization the loss of judgement of self Kurtzs monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a Green Beret and his later revelation is one of the most chilling and well-delivered speeches in cinema history The film is about trauma about the human spirit and its breaking point - here its a lot like The Deer Hunter and just as good Apocalypse however takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level - Coppolas sweeping footage of the humid murky jungles of Cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky - set to an oddly fitting Doors soundtrack - as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with Wagner blasting from speakers (a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling darkly humorous and strikingly pointless war scenes ever) - this all contributes to the sense of Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future but Apocalypse Now and forever The Deer Hunter is much more up close and personal you can even tell by the title and shows the totalling effect trauma has on the individual psyche the breaking down of the human soul and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness or to limp on This is why both films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing In Heart of Darkness Kurtz is shown as conflicted between morality (civilization) and his inner savage In Apocalypse Now Kurtz has left all conflict behind He is beyond good and evil He has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before his death Kurtz indeed is only waiting for death quoting T S Eliot in his temple to himself lost in the jungle His last words and the words echoed at the end of the movie are The horrorthe horror He is referring to the infinite void of existence of the human psyche and to the pitch black emptiness within his own mind where atrocities are born again It is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film - the experience in short that Willard experiences on his journey The end part at the outpost almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in The Deer Hunter is one of the most deeply calmly and seductively disturbing things Ive ever seen
Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs and those that challenge them This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like The Longest Day and The Green Berets which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison The Apocalypse Now! project the production and resulting film is Heart of Darkness updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve This is the plight of Joseph Conrads original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliots The Hollow Men (Mistah Kurtz he dead) of 1925 Although neither a straight telling of Conrads Heart of Darkness (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience Apocalypse Now! stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential Apocalypse is not just about the horrors of war per se like Platoon and The Deer Hunter but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experiencedbr br The bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance) aboard a US military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerners would ever tread His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) a career army Special Forces Division officer who was the darling of the US Military until he went AWOL and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between Vietnam Laos and Cambodia The official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity Sheens mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public none the wiserbr br The movie is rather episodic The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as Sheen and his crew meet different self-contained aspects of the war at the ground level American audiences of the 1970s had probably never seen this kind of film-making before with the possible exception of The Deer Hunter which was released in the previous year The first and one of the most notable is an helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner He loves to play Ride of the Valkyries from Wagners The Ring when he bombards helpless villages His line I love the smell of Napalm in the morning is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunniesbr br Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film Not even the likes of Clive Barker Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery Brandos Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from withinbr br Without giving too much away Coppolas solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations According to the documentary Hearts of Darkness Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama and the atmosphere of the movies darker hues would be compromised He wasnt sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at his village After the viewing Coppola had his ending and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making Love it or hate it no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scenebr br This film is not for all tastes just as Conrads original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes Its not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb Its the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle which is as it should be Coppola did not make a family picture However if the viewer can understand its larger point there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now! If youre looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism better stick with John Wayne But if youre willing to be taken into places youve never been even beyond the evils of war rhetoric Apocalypse Now will take you into a world you thought youd never visited before and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it
Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces it is hard for Capt Willard to understand how Col Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willards long journey through the jungle to find his target he tries with some success to understand why But what will he decide to do once he finds him?br br Any movie that can start out with The Doors The End is a great movie in my book especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song Apocalypse Now does this perfectly I cant think of anything better for it to be set to the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders minds that it created AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam the ultimate destination of which is murder Through its use of music and score alone we are thrown into a dark world of mystery violence and insanity A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here br br An overall great cast with the exception of Laurence Fishburne of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread I just dont like Fishburne ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWees playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care We need to sick Gary Oldman on him Brando is excellent as Col Kurtz and I cant think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvalls Lt Colonel Kilgore Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly its my favorite of his parts to date He simply nailed his character which is one of the best in the entire film as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant I also love the smell of napalm in the morningbr br The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesnt take too much brainpower to figure out whats going on Willards mission is to kill Kurtz plain and simple But its the journey of the film that is really its heart and also the dire situations of war itself In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the films entirety other than it makes it a longer journey I dont feel they take away anything though its just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original Through this journey the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in itin fact thats the entire point On top of that the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz to go completely mad br br A big war movie lover this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter all of them classics I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what Ive said All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam Warso to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointlesseven if after having most recently view AN I think its a tad better In the end Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status its been given As a fellow reviewer has previously stated AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made
Spoilers This review has been edited due to word limitbr br The horror The horror Marlon Brando Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)br br The sentence which is as famous as Heres looking at you kid or Are you talkin to me? or May the Force be with you or Ill be back means a little more than some one-liners When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single framebr br What exactly does this line of dialogue mean? The horror spoken of is the reality of war The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt When Capt Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Col Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film The horrorthe horror is the realization of Willards corruptness He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment This isnt a typical Hollywood ending In most cases a character gains something whether it be emotionally physically mentally or all three But Willard both gains and loses He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals And that is a shocking endingbr br Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppolas tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking This film is wholly different from The Godfather It is hallucinogenic visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature At first it seems realistic and then it becomes strange and then symbolic and by the end original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war within usbr br At first it does appear to be another war film Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz (Brando) who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slavesbr br Willard carries out his mission with extreme prejudice heading out on a boat along with four soldiers including the boat captain Chief (Albert Hall) Chef (Frederic Forest) and a very young Larry Fishburne (who later went on to appear as Morpheus in The Matrix)br br Apocalypse Now is in a many ways a modern update of Homers Odyssey As our main character Willard carries on his journey he meets an array of original and strange characters including Lt Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who has a strange fetish for surfing and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper) whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in The Million Dollar Hotel one of the worst films I have ever seen Davies failed to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages In this case he is translating Kurtz to Willard although Im not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willardbr br Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines Apocalypse Now has many Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagners Ride of the Valkyries remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history There is sharpness to it a brutality to it an ironic tone to it and also a sense of playfulness When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says I love the smell of napalm in the morningit smells like victory we all crack a smilebr br I wont lie to you: Apocalypse Now is a strange film It isnt exactly the easiest thing to analyze The end may frustrate some viewers if they dont understand Marlon Brandos significant speeches But what it all comes down to what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche The horror is the realization of war and its effects not the war itself Kurtz says You have a right to kill me But you have no right to judge me Brandos character Kurtz is left to the audience to judge To many naïve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head But that isnt what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across By fighting in Vietnam Kurtz has realized just how great he had it and how bad some others had it By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the naïve ones living our lives in a fools paradise We are totally naïve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something Just how easily he could end up like the people around him And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door Many people think the horror is one thing It is two For Kurtz the horror is the reality of how naïve he was and the reality of the wars impact upon men And after Willard murders Kurtz and hears Kurtzs dying words he realizes it too He realizes the effects of war To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man And what it has done to him The horrorbr br 55 stars -br br 
Well Ive watched this movie for over 25 years now and its still almost as interesting as when I first saw it It is definitely one of the most unique films ever madebr br I still think Martin Sheen got dissed big-time in the billing too He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours 17 minutes film (theatrical version) How unfair is that?br br Sheen is fantastic in here especially his narration which runs throughout Its one of the best narrations if not THE best I have ever heard in a movie His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible nightmare-like adventure I never fail to appreciate his work in this moviebr br The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes ones I have never forgotten such asbr br Sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movies first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagners dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brandos bizarre character It goes on and on with strange scenesbr br Thats not to say I enjoyed everything No there are a few very unpleasant scenes such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (cant watch that anymore) an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheens young stoned-out crew and the crew is a little too goofy at times Then there is the huge amount of profanity led by way too many f-wordsbr br So there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this One thing for sure: it is a film you WILL remember!
From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out It has this freakish feel to it Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies What does push to such a high level is the: br br The directing was spectacular here Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war Most others just display and show you the horrors of war Coppola though makes you feel confused shocked and scared These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film The writing was of course amazing too It brought you write into the middle of the movie It never made me bored and this movie is three hours The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calmbr br The acting was bone-chilling Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded out of whack colonel When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now With Brando n this film you dont want to look into his eyes Like the movie he was freakish To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming Also Duvalls character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both lovebr br I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting directing writing cinematography and great ending Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now
After the success of the first two Godfather films in 1972 and 1974 respectively Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975 The plot was loosely based on the book Heart of Darkness a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the nativesCoppola retains much of this including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtzs headquarters and his final words The horror the horror br br In the film Sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into Cambodia and eliminate with extreme prejudice a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities On his journey up the river to the renegades camp he experiences the demoralization of the US forces high on dope or drunk with power br br Although as a result of cuts forced on Coppola the film was accused of incoherence when first released it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of Vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound br br Apocalypse Now was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored As a result the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is
This movie changed the art of film making telling a complex story in a powerful new way The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke The film uses music not as a score laid in later but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers radios etc Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration taking scenes and characters and putting them into entirely different surroundings That is a tricky and brave thing to do Then he takes a superstar Brando pays him a fortune and films him so that you can barely see his face The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding and it works beautifully This movie belongs in the top ten
Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (Spielberg Copolla and others are named there) The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isnt a great director The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician most of his films lack depthSaving Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view but its message is dull and while its very entertaining it doesnt make you think about anything AN is the best movie I ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things starting from war in general the clash of civilizations the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither the french lady says he is both ) and many others The problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false But a great movie and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments not to solve them  Maybe Coppola is right or maybe he isnt nobody holds the truth anyway You can watch this movie for its outer beauty amazing scenes great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality You cant help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentaryBoth Copolla and Moore tackle similar issues but while Copolla presents matters from an outside  objective point of view Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary  It is really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 911 won a prestigious award like Cannes But anyway if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war the Iraq war the second World War and any war in general you should definitely see this movie and not the other one 
Francis Ford Coppolas Apocalypse Now is not a Vietnam War film Do not confuse it with one It is set to the back drop of the war but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche It is also one of the most audacious films ever made produced or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the films production levelsbr br Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors The End as Martin Sheens Captain Benjamin L Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes Willards mission is to terminate with extreme prejudice Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and as told by his general is out there operating without any decent restraint totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct And he is still in the field commanding troops Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god For Willard this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat yet the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behaviorbr br Teaming up with a small crew they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat Along the way Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz During Sheens raspy voice over he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret He was a normal man with a family until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz As he reads about this mythic figure he is drawn to the mans power and why he has become what he has become We know that Willards slow decay will parallel that of Kurtzsbr br Marlon Brando has been revered for decades His presence: unmatchable His genius: undeniable But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance Brando can be perceived in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer as a hack He is most certainly not Brando was difficult to work with hard to interpret and impossible to understand but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didnt His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profunditybr br If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppolas actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one mans fanatical struggle to produce a movie It is reported that during the films 200 plus day principle photography schedule Coppola contemplated suicide The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch Coppolas sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheens haunted soldier Willardbr br I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace Audacity aside Apocalypse Now is pure film-making My respect and admiration for Mr Coppola is of the highest order But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for todays standards for film: a lack of innovation It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart But we still have the great ones like Coppolas masterpiece a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehendbr br That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness The killing can disturb The loss of innocence can unhinge But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual the savage and the animalistic If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis
i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie ive never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels they just dont make movies like this anymorebr br after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness) im even more amazed that this film even got finished yet alone turn out so greatbr br the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Phillipines is the films greatest asset you actually FEEL like your in Vietnambr br all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being Robert Duvall (I love the smell of napalm in the morning!!) martin sheen and the great Marlon Brandobr br a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky weird and cerebral near the end well remeber what Coppolla said about this movie This film is not about vietnam it IS vietnam! what he means is that this film is about MADNESS and not the warbr br this movie is based on the short story Heart of darkness by Joseph Conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinionbr br this is perfect challenging film that is dark violent humorous at times and well done in every single possible waybr br a true classicbr br rating:10
Apocalypse Now Redux Francis Ford Coppolas war opus is probably the most beautiful war film I have ever seen Capt Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into Cambodia to terminate the position of Col Kurtz (Marlon Brando) a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers Escorting him up the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men and along the way they encounter several interesting people (most notably is Robert Duvalls Kilgore a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrifying situations br br Apocalypse is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study It is more Full Metal Jacket than Platoon The running time of Apocalypse is over three hours but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived I was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed The beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me however After seeing this film I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history The Godfather films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone and shadows created the feeling of a Baroque composition With Apocalypse there is an incredible usage of natural light and the shadows particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen almost become a living character they are so pervasive and effective Another gorgeous scene was when Cpt Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes and come across a tiger The sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian but the colorization of the scene was incredible While everything else was almost a muted grey the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green an effect that was particularly striking Another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attack the small village while playing Wagner This could have just been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene but instead Coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to scare the hell out of them br br The performances in Apocalypse are first class Much has been made of the amount of money Brando earned for the film and the amount of trouble he caused Regardless of this he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time Sheen is completely outstanding - this is the first time I have seen him really unleash in a film  and Duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony Kilgore Apocalypse Now is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now (most know several choice lines from the film I love the smell of napalm in the morning et al) but I knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience I have not seen the original cut of Apocalypse Now so I cannot compare it to this newer cut but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced 810br br --Shelly
During the final throes of the Vitnam war our central character Capt Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has allegedly gone completely insane but who is successfully waging a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia a neutral and therefore off-limits countrybr br The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as he is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we dont understand something and we are unable to control it exterminate it Kurtz had eventually come to know thisbr br Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtzs darkened lair you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie Kurtzs subtle deal with his executioner his unilateral surrender in return for Willard agreeing (did he nod?) to tell Kurtzs son (another metaphor for us the next generation the ones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam is mind-expanding stuffThe bonding between the two men whilst Kurtz cross-examines Willard--interlaced with some of his own horror stories is incredible nay genius film The closing (intercut)scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols Coppolla has made intentionally or not the ultimate anti-war statement one that should resonate through the ages
As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film I find it very interesting how few middle of the road comments there are Everyone either loves it or they hate it Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????) I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film Why would you like a film thats so confusing? ask many of my associates The answer is this: Forget the war forget the brutalityThis is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job he does it too well without adhering to the accepted standards of death and destruction (Am I the only one whos troubled by the fact that we have standards for death and destruction????) so they send the Conformity Police out to eliminate the individual HmmmmmmDraw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr Coppola whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time I think he transcended his original intent of the movie and probably didnt even realize it until after the movie was released The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead it seems to have grown itself like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production as did the cast and crew but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold So if you havent seen the movie rent it watch it then watch it again and maybe a few more times and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film Those of you that have seen it watch it again with the mindset previously described I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!
I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time  I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it br br This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie  I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound  editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted  and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border br br How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but hes everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director  I said  was  in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head  but his sacrifice was worth it  In John Milius original solo draft we have a script thats just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen  but Coppolas involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war  Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldnt have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes  so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension  When Coppola states  This movie isnt about Vietnam - It is Vietnam  hes right  What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the films setting ( The Manson trial suggests its 1970 ) had changed Americas view of both the world and itself and of the worlds view of America br br Its the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime  Ive not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didnt feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic  In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel whos leading an injun war party  or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier whos leading a resistance movement on Mars  though this is probably down to Joseph Conrads original source novelbr br My all time favourite movie and its very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb
My favourite movie of all time This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary Heart of Darkness made it even more compelling Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making the Godfather and GodfatherII and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like Apocalypse Now Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col Kurtzs compound And just like Willard he DIDNT know what he was going to do once he got there This is such a masterpiece of American cinema beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story What I like most about Apocalypse Now is that it offers no answers or conclusions Consequently because of this open-endedness it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious br br This movie defies categorization Some call it a war movie which it isnt at all really it is more of a personal study of man The best pic about Vietnam is Platoon in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers br br Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with GenCorman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classicbr br It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratificationbr br A little footnote definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now watch the original version first the Redux version is I think more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a new and improved version of the movie
Touching Bollywood epic melodrama about a 10 year-old girl who finds out that shes adopted and is determined to find her birth mother The films major success is the performance of PS Keerthana who plays the girl The first half of the film is very good There are a few really good songs too especially the number that introduces the protagonist Unfortunately the films second half which takes place in war-torn Sri Lanka feels like an entirely different and disappointing movie Its big on explosions and special effects with Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels dodging grenades running from fireballs and being yanked by stunt wires All the film can offer as insight are cheap platitudes like Some day there must come peace and Perhaps the children will find a way The final sequence where the daughter and mother are reunited is good but so over-the-top with the music and a well-timed downpour that it feels like a cheat I know I know its all in the style of Bollywood But this is a story where big moments simply detract from the simple powerful central story Bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times too
Recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film by Director Mani Ratnam at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival I have bestowed my highest honour of the Film Festival on this feature Make sure that you do not let an opportunity to experience this cinematic gem pass you by  but be forewarded: this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as homo sapien! A 10 !!
Last night I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles) Oddly it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDbbr br At first I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it At the beginning a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated Months later the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India At a refugee center you see the lady about to give birth--after which the titles to the film finally are revealedbr br The entire focus of the film then changes completely--to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras India You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family None of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing--what about the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film Somehow or another she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad #2--though she did NOT realize these people were not her biological parentsbr br Soon after this the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film) as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage AND tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother Seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents (particularly the adoptive mother) was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interestbr br Unfortunately Sri Lanka has been involved in a very very long and brutal civil war with Tamilese militants off and on for three decades The familys decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka was indeed noble but also a bit stupid at times--as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war! This was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents--first you tell her she ISNT your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE!!! Sure the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother but this really was stupid in hind sight If it were me I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid--thus avoiding being in the middle of a war!br br Despite my complaints the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding Far from perfect it sure hits an emotional home run Also while I expected this because I have seen several Indian films many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where--this IS standard in most films from India--including those made in Bollywood (Bombay) and TamilwoodKollywood (Madras)
It pays to watch Readers Digest Or Time if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece Based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents Mr Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practisesbr br Where does one start? The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer-author and 3 adorably naughty children? Or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredulous and sinister events and ideologies? Whichever way one looks at it this film is worth being in your collection if you happen to like Mani Ratnams compelling dramasbr br Mr Ratnam is a past master in blending fictional tales within real life incidents and in this film he oozes class in adapting two real-life stories into one I will not go into the story as it is better seen than read But what I will dwell upon is the impact it had upon me and why for all the war-mongering that happens in this world it cannot destroy that simple yet inexhaustible force called hopebr br Innocence in its purity cannot fathom the complex desires of adult decadence and greed Nor does it recognize perils when it is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants It is an innocence of such nature that drives Amudha to seek her biological parents despite warnings that they could be lost in the cauldron of civil war Having survived a terrorizing experience of conversing with a physically challenged man only to realize that he is a more lethal entity in disguise Amudha sticks to her cause in a manner that tears down her well-wishers resistance And finally when the twain do meet mother and daughter the reunion is so taut with emotion that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears Aided by a coruscating background score from A R Rahman the scene that follows is poignant to melt even the stoniest of hearts: a list of questions that Amudha has to ask her biological mother In a culmination as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to it a child discovers its mother alive in body but lost in spirit With the crushing realization that she has no hope of staying with the one who bore her Amudha does to her adoptive mother what this films title means: a peck on the cheekbr br As for the cast the trail is clearly blazed by the brilliant PS Keerthana Mr Ratnam has a gift of extracting spectacular performances from little-known child artistes but this should take nothing away from Keerthana for an award-winning performance With an able supporting cast of Madhavan (Thiru) Simran (Indira) and the stupendous Nandita Das (Shyama) she embellishes the scenes in almost every frame she is in The music may be not as memorable as other Rahman offerings but that still didnt stop him from garnering another National Award for the best music direction Vellai Pookal is as much an ode for the need to cherish human life as it is for nature The dialogues are top-class (sample the touching exchange Amudha and Indira have on the swing shortly after the revelation that she is not Indiras biological daughter) and the cinematography superbbr br This film is a clear statement to drop arms as much as it is to respect human life and expressions Do not judge it as a lesson in film-making; you will only lose out on experiencing one of the very best from the Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman stable
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal Such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion Mani Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots(In fact this was the only movie where he went outside India everthat too just to sri lanka)Manis class is written all over the movieand to add to it ARRs musicwhich is just amazingVellai Pookal is one of my most fav songs ever Maddywho is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too Starting from alaipayuthey to kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru Mani ratnam has showed to the world what a versatile actor Maddy is Simran has been really good too She has showed that she can act too in non-glamorous and character roles In all an amazing movie Sad that the tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 movie and it bombed at the box-office
This film is absolute gold If you havent seen it do Mani Ratnam outdoes himself once again This film introduced me to Nandita Das as well though everyone shines in this movie My only regret is Ive never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of Southern India as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart Beautiful subtle witty with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer this movie stands up to being seen again and again and the story within the story The Umbrella is done so well as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book Lovely Watch it
I have seen this movie when it was released and no doubt it is heart touching I liked the point of view of a kid who came to know that what she was thinking about her were actually not true Its a shatter to that small kid And her search to find out who she is And before and after she knows about her the relationship between her and her foster-mom Thats a nice view A R Rahman adds his stress by a good re-recording and songs In this movie mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advices (like in Vuyire) but simply narrates the characters as they are  And because of that the film exactly strikes the audience The pool bath scene of chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas did not convey perfectly what it meant for Mani Ratnam has amazingly improved
When you want to celebrate life and love especially for precious little daughters you have to shout it from the countryside And what gorgeous countrysides! There are so many tears of joy even God joins in See this moviebr br 
Kannathil Muthamittal is for sure a great movie I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great directing job and AR Rahman for great songs The camera work is just excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work
Hello all! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam wouldve given an excellent film! I was stunned!! The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse the cinematography editing and all other technical details Full marks to the cast and crew I have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there Excellent work! Though the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan such a work was never attempted on Indian Screen Overall the movie is great! And hats off to MrManiratnambr br Mani Ratnam has once again proved that he is a director who can take Indian cinema to great heights! I would love to watch this film again and again An excellent film and a must see
To tell you the truth I do not speak Tamil and I did not understand the film My good Tamil friend Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow what a long name) explained every thing to me What a great movie!!! After watching this movie I felt I should have watched many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry) The war scenes were amazing camera work excellent and plot beautiful The actress Simran what a beauty Give her an award for best looking someone Ding Ding Ding come on I smell a OSCAR winner I didnt understand the songs but they were excellent Mani Ratnam is a great director and I hope his next film was a success
You dont have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movieI dont know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to meUnderstanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but I could make out the story because the lead actors (and actresses)emoted really wellAnd the little girl was really cute (she wasnt irritating like child actors in most hindi movies)The story is really touching and hats off to Mr Ratnam for trying something differentThe relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically(I could identify with the characters in the movie)It was alltogether a movie that will remain in my heart forever and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to my friendsAlso the songs are just out of this world!They were beautifully and meaningfully picturisedIf only I could understand the right meaning of the lyrics:(
I think this is one of the best tamil movies ive seen in a while i love the fact that it doesnt revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly The cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother Best of all are the songs beautiful music and moving lyrics There are some great songs in this move yall! especially Kannathil Mutthamittal and Velai Pookal Great songs both of them I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting (and superb songs! ) Cheers Simran
When I stepped into the theater I thought this was going to be a great movie And I was not disappointed one bit WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran Beautiful music by AR Rahman This might most probably be the best Tamil movie Ive seen in ages Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt moviesbr br This movie is basically about a young girl (PS Keerthana) who is in search of her biological mother (Nandita Das) who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (JD Chakravathy) A young novelist (Madhavan) finds out about this young girls story and decides to write a story about her He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological motherbr br This movie really screams EXCELLENT The way Mani Ratnam presented the movie is magnificent br br My Rating - 1010
This is an incredible movie that begins slowly It leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama Then in the second half there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scopebr br If you are unaccustomed to films from India with song and dance routines seemingly grafted on for no reason stick with this movie Especially beginning with the second half you will find this movie an amazing experiencebr br  Minor Spoiler Here  I have but one complaint with the movie The dialog at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring in the war as a force that transforms peoples lives It was implied all along but there should have been something about the importance of the struggle for MDS
One more classic performance by Maniratnam and his team They can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an all time classic The war and its impacts in Sri Lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect Madhavan no wonder he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role he plays and it needs real daringness to act as a father for three kids when he is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry Music by AR Rahman makes the movie a special one for those who love melodies Above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times
Mani is back wit a Rathnam(gem) he manages to capture the mental trauma of a small girl searching 4 her mother they way he goes about showing the problems-in Ceylon is a treat  Tis movie is a must watchthe musical score does enhance the viewing pleasure Rahman a find of Rathnam has given some great tunes the lyrics r apt 4 the movie the locations used for the movie are very good and makes viewing pleasant the movie starts of in a light manner moves over to capture the feelings of the girl finally goes on o shed light into the life of people in war torn places across the world this is yet another classic from ManiRathnam
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yeras Eve watching an amazing drama unfold It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child Several years later we see Amudha a playful well-loved child (P S Keerthana) who is the darling (or burden) of teachers parents and fellow schoolmates alike in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not their biological child she was adopted This tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her Several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother The country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess But this also leads to their meeting the new Shyama - one who finally is confronted by Amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughterbr br The story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother the unconditional love of the adoptive parents the demons that drive the birth mother the normalcy of Chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring AR Rahmans music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film The film has excellent performances from Madhavan Nandita Das Simran and an absolute stunner role as Amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste P S Keerthana This performance won her a National awardbr br The cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot I am intrigued by the connection Mani Ratnam has with terrorism love and obsessions I think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding Mahadevans character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl His one liners were hilarious The mother played by Simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids The shock angst and obsession of the child Amudha was outstandingly portrayed by P S Keerthana Her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking In fact the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das and her husband Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes It also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedybr br Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - I rarely weep in the movies but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick This is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film!
The Director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian film I had seen Dil Se which led me down the path of buying well over 122 Hindi DVDs in thebr br course of four months I can say I understood the total attraction I wasbr br somehow confused as to why the film would stop for music videos It was an excellent movie I didnt know what to make of the dancing and the femalebr br vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears but somehow I found AR Rahmens score hypnotic I bought the soundtrack the following day and then Lagan Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and with the exception of Ichi thebr br killer a few other Korean films  I cant be bothered to watch much else Kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of Hong Kong Horrorbr br and ActionScience fiction films for the past 30 yearsbr br But I should get back to Kannathil Muthamittal It is one of the Mani Ratmans latest efforts and I laughed Cried Got totally mad terrified and most of all I didnt feel manipulated The acting was superb the photography was beautiful I think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting The music fit the movie perfectly and after thebr br credits rolled I wanted to watch again so I didbr br It would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop This is what great film is all about! I stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over!br br My wife is watching now and I cant wait for her reaction I cant expect it will be anything less than mine
This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary and the acting spectacular At first I thought this wasnt going to be that great because of a summary but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that I was dead wrong I literally cried about four or five times in this movie and despite this I mustve watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No the song scenes were not as awesome as they couldve been but the plot is what really gets you American or Asain I would recommend this to anyone--and I have now I guarantee that after seeing this one youll get the best out of it and its plot I hope you feel the same and write a rave review too!
Kannathil Muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies ive seen in a long time the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her parentage she sets out in an endeavour to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terroristbr br the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity mani ratnam generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best moviesbr br the movie is emotionally draining and tugs at the heart of the viewer keerthana as the 9 year old amudha and simran as her adopted mother are simply brilliant their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie there are some notable flaws here particularly the scene where amudha learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did another flaw is surprisingly enough the brilliant songs they again seem forced and stand out not gelling with the rest of the scriptbr br having said these this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in teh technical brilliance as well ravi chandrans camera work is sheer poetry all characters perform creditably and the realistic humour especially in teh flashback scenes are entertainingbr br a sincere 9!!
In Sri Lanka a country divided by religion and language the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) a separatist organization has claimed an estimated 68000 lives since 1983 Human rights groups have said that as a result of the war more than one million people have been displaced homeless or living in camps The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek winner of several awards at the National Film Awards in India While the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girls voyage of discovery the human cost of war is made quite clear and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoingbr br Beautifully photographed in Southern India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of Sri Lanka the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in Sri Lanka Played with deep feeling and expressiveness by PS Keerthana in a memorable performance Amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out leaving her in a Red Cross camp In a loving flashback we see Amudhas adoptive parents father Thiru (Madhavan) a prominent Tamil writer and mother Indra (Simran) a TV personality marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girlbr br Young Amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday according to the parents prior agreement While she is playing Thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that you are not our daughter and the response is predictable Distraught she questions who her father was what her mothers name was why she gave her up and so forth but few answers are forthcoming Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother now a fighter for the Tamil separatists The familys immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions handled mostly with skill by Ratnam though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurishbr br A Peck on the Cheek is of course a Bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama The melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however I found the musical dramatizations of songs by A R Rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing Yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the films limitations Tamil cinema has been criticized by many even within the country as being too clichéd and commercial yet A Peck on the Cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues That it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute
I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamilbr br Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up withBy the way to all we westerners Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotionbr br Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like Devdas to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges toppled Lagaan last yearbr br Devdas is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of Love fate and destiny I would keep away from it Anyway not sending a movie like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a revamp Indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence Now I know why this country has so many issues They are heavily talented but not showcased properly
Sri Lanka not a country Ive ever given much thought to I have to admit I didnt even know it was near India let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983 It seems that the rebels of the Tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the islandbr br Mani Ratmans latest film A PECK ON THE CHEEK tells the story of a young girl named Amudha who is separated from her Sri Lankan parents by the war and raised by a young Indian couple Amudha is a bright and mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child Although her adopted parents love her as much as could be and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children Amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological familybr br Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story (or is it the other way around?) A PECK ON THE CHEEK inhabits similar territory but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers The central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family and especially that between a child and her adopted parents Its a pretty honest and open look at feelings that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others Its an emotionally complex film with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human waybr br The film revolves around 9 year old Amudha played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress PS Keerthana in her first and only acting role Shes a princess and a monster always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long The young actress is perfectly cast for the role and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of herbr br A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name I was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience Never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact I dare say The film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screenbr br Mani Ratmans direction is superb very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work Ive seen from this director yet The film is visually very stylish with some excellent camerawork and imagery AR Rahman provides the films soundtrack which is not as good as his classic DIL SE or BOMBAY music (based on first impressions at least) but still shows his great musical talentbr br Im not aware of a DVD release for the film yet - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight The production is a truly world class effort and I am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposurebr br Recommended
I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festivalbr br This is the first Indian film Ive seen in the Tamil language and while it does share some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography sweeping storyline) the director attempts more than just to entertain The film tells the story of Amudha a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka Gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point though it is a simplistic one Amudha is played by PS Keerthana and she is one of the few child actors Ive seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying Her charm and beauty held the film together
Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people only to have a heart attack himself! He ends up dying on an operating table and for the sake of revenge his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson) who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demonbr br While I know enough about the directors filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock Nurse Sherri is really not all that bad Sure its clear that this was very low-budget stuff yet all that I found egregiously cheesy about it were the visual effects The acting is not as bad as one might expect eitherbr br There are two different versions available of this on DVD A much more sex-oriented version featuring bountiful amounts of T & A is the original cut with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their strangest sex moments including one involving fellatio during a college lecture!br br The movie would then be re-cut for theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly Some scenes are dropped with new ones added (with Stevens the role played by JC Wells expanded) The movies most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a foundry and it works quite well This cut of the movie is more interesting overall; I would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare thembr br Both versions hit their stride in the final third and benefit from a marvelously scene-stealing performance from Bill Roy as the crazed Reanhauer and a moody climax set in a graveyard (although actually filmed in Adamsons backyard!) Marilyn Joi is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden) whos lost his eyes in a car accident and who incidentally is key to resolving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals The movie also makes amusing use of music from composer Harry Lubins personal collection including compositions for such TV series as One Step Beyond and The Outer Limitsbr br Nurse Sherri (known by more alternate titles (including Beyond the Living and Hospital of Terror) than any other Adamson movie) is actually fairly entertaining low-budget fare I ended up having a good time watching itbr br 710
Meet Sherrifor an evening of Pleasure and Terror! Cheap special effectscheesy linesyep its the original 1978 Movie Nurse Sherri Starting Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmondand Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and Directed by Al Adamsonbr br The movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospitalthen she starts killing doctors one by oneThe acting was okay but some of the acting was roboticThe storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more viewsThe directing was badAnd the special effects looked like a drawingthe effects didnt fool anybodythe death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didnt make any sense like the sex scenesthe nuditythe football playerand many morebr br Overall Its A Good MovieBut Not The Bestbr br 7 Out Of 10
I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career but The Possession of Nurse Sherri stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-Z schlockfests like Horror of the Blood Monsters and Dracula Vs Frankenstein This film is actually scary! Am I saying that youre going to jump out of your seat when you watch Nurse Sherri? No of course not But this pastiche of elements from The Exorcist Ruby and Carrie is one of those nice eerie little horror movies common to the seventies You cant put your finger on whats so spooky about it but the film drips with atmosphere (And what an ending! Dont worry I wont spoil it for you) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed it with this one and it doesnt matter whether Nurse Sherri was a calculated success or a happy accident Jill Jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy who shines in his brief role) Geoffrey Land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing Nurse Sherri was a Poverty Row production and it shows at times (sets special effects etc) Still the film has heart mostly decent acting and direction and some genuine chills Sam Sherman also saw fit to use Harry Lubins theme music for the late 50searly 60s television series One Step Beyond in this film which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere The DVD contains two significantly different cuts of the movie (the early version features a lot of T&A that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff) as well as the theatrical trailer the TV spot and a great commentary by Sherman Does anybody know whatever happened to Bill Roy by the way? Next to John Carradine hes the best actor Ive ever seen in an Al Adamson film and he plays the cult leader like he means it
What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? Youd think so by some of the reviews Al Adamsons films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy not much more so if you go into them knowing that already it helps and they arent necessarily to be taken at face value especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value First off this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits so you know things are looking promising This is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital Of course Nurse Sherri tends to his needs and all and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her And Nurse Sherri begins to change No longer the nice nurse she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects Theres a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of Sherris co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo This is not bad if youre a cult film fan but it may be bad if youre a Spiderman fan because you wont like it At times this actually lurches towards respectability (for Adamson anyway) but then it unredeems: itself with some ridiculous event If you enjoy Adamsons films and similar trash you may well like this for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure keep digging 7 out of 10
This is one of those games where you love it to bits or hate it to shredsEven being a hardcore Mario fan can make you dislike this gameYou can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and easyOr you can love it because it is a mixture of amazing graphics(not a Nintendo fan huge excitement) music or game playI know a lot of people that say it is amazingand others who think its the worst Mario everIt really depends on the type of Nintendo fan you areI personally love this game and I think it is the best wii gamebut you should determine that for yourselfSo I think you should absolutely get it if you are the right Nintendo fanBut If you love The classics too muchyou may not like itSo try it out yourself
Ever since 1981 Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because theyre always adding something new It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that theres a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011 The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons br br And I have more good news Super Mario Galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010
(Warning: May Contain Spoilers) Let Rosalina help Mario lead the way and smile because this game will brighten your day br br 120 stars will require luck and skill but 60 will bring you as much of a thrill!br br Blasting through stars show Mario and Luigi and what travelers they now are! br br Walking upside down has never been more fun especially a final battle with Koopa near the Sun! br br This is truly a super awesome game and it absolutely deserves a place in Nintendos Hall of Fame!
Like some other people wrote Im a die-hard mario fan and I loved this game br br This game starts slightly boring but trust me its worth it As soon as you start your hooked! The levels are fun and exiting They will hook you till your mind turns to mush Im not kidding This game is also orchestrated and is beautifully done br br To keep this spoiler free I have to keep my mouth shut about details But please try this game! Itll be worth it!br br Story: 99 Action: 101 (Its that good!) Hardness: 10 Attention Grabber: 10 Average: 10
the mario series is back and in my opinion better than ever Galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64 the controls are great; some of the best for the wii beautiful graphical design as well the levels are very big and the good old bosses are back there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64 and 2: the difficulty isnt very high; though it does require some patience mario fans: the game youve been waiting for Casual gamers: this game is more than worth the buy 98 out of 10
THIS COMMENT WILL PROBABLY HAVE SPOILERS!! I CHECKED THE SPOILERS BOX JUST IN CASE BUT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE SPOILERS BUT BE AWARE ANYWAYS IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER A SPOILER AND I DONT! Wowbest game since Super Mario 64 I got this game the first day it came out and before I got it I went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings (yes they already reviewed it before it came out) and I was shocked I was expecting something like Sunshine because lately all the Mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse But this one totally beat the other games The scores on this game even beat Halo 3! Its simply amazingbr br STORY: Not the best Mario games are never known for their plots and this one isnt really much of a difference Bowser once again kidnaps Peach but this time invades the Mushroom Kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer spacebr br GRAPHICS: Absolutely gorgeous the best graphics on Wii so far The water effects are really nice too if you ever see the water it looks so real because the effects they put in itbr br MUSIC: Simply amazing the music in this game is orchestrated Not all of it but even the ones that arent orchestrated still sound very nicebr br GAMEPLAY: Very entertaining keeps you wanting to play more and more and for me since usually I tend to be very frustrated with games if I die a lot I mean Im definitely not the only one but this game for me didnt have that a lot Now it still kind of did but not to the point like Mario 64 where I totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad this one never did thatbr br DIFFICULTY: There are two types of difficulty because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars which I think is kind of easy but to beat the game 100% you have to get 120 like always and that quest is way harder but at the same time still very funbr br LENGTH: Good length definitely not too short It took me around 15-16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars but 120 took me more like 45-50 hours Now I didnt play it constantly that much I played first a lot one day then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day then the next two days I played it all day To me though I think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short so if you want a long game I suggest getting all of thembr br PRESENTATION: Now the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb The way they are it just looks so much like something I would see in the theaters They are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any Mario game so farbr br OVERALL: This game is definitely a great game and I advise you to not wait until Christmas get it as soon as possible This game also is a good mixture of old and new youll have some sidescroller levels where you move just side to side or up and down because theyll change on gravity but even the music has some old classics in it So this game seems to be like a masterpiece To me its my favorite Mario game of all time but others may disagree But its still a great game I recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this
I have been a Mario fan for as long as I can remember I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in spacebr br The story begins much like any other Mario game Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom Upon arriving at Peachs castle Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr) attacking the castle with their airships Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Lumas home a floating space station here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader a woman named Rosalina Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space stations Power Stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach thus the adventure beginsbr br The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic Mario environments The best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment Then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the Wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 gamesbr br My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives Still these minor problems aside its a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging This is the type of game that weve been waiting for on the Wiibr br A perfect 10 out of 10!
I saw what I believe to be the best Australian film of the year so far Jon Hewitts Acolytesbr br Acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise Get thistwo bullied and molested teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb AND then set about blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them Hewitt has picked a top notch cast including excellent new comers Sebastian Gregory Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teens Add to that three yes thats right three great psychos! Lead by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour Belinda McClory his deranged spouse and Michael Dorman as the teen raping bully with swastika tattoos Once you add these teens and these menacing adults all hell breaks loose Hewitt has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynchs Twin Peaks but Hewitt makes it all his own in a Qld suburban back water always ringing with the drones of emptiness The script by Shayne Armstong Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tightbr br If marketed correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens The next Wolf Creek? It could well be It makes all the right moves The teens are real ala Larry Clark They dont suck and have an attached PC agenda they are non communicative good looking and hip The killers are dark with real menace Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the mild mannered local Ted Bundy who sports a butterfly on his 4WD spare ala John Fowles The Collector Dormans petrol head rapist pours on the menace that tops Suburban Mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you cant wait to see buy the farmbr br The film is fast paced tough and brutal Not only that it displays a confidence and directorial mastery from Hewitt that is surely to win him an IF or AFI nomination if not award! Its nuanced and poetic mise en scene brilliant sound design excellent cinematography and tight structure mark it as clearly one of the best directed Oz features I have seen so far this yearbr br The film leaves you shaken thinking and unsettled Its a truly great edition to the return to genre going on in Australian cinema at present It will surely garner the interest of Hollywood Oh and did I mention it got into Toronto? What other Oz feature films can say that much? The world should get ready for a new auteur Jon Hewitt
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment I watched this not expecting too much from it The Fact is that the cast were superb Especially The lead Teen Female The dark sides of them all came through all were messed up in an not obvious way There was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality The serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children What this movie is is a strong dramathriller Yes I would agree they dont do the obvious but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable Also a decent dark ending instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one The attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also I very good solid 7 out of 10 A little slow at times but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from
One of Chaplins longest films up to that point Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then Prosper Merimees well-known story about Carmen I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDbs listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer and from what Ive read those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes br br From the very beginning its clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplins most complex and ambitious efforts to date starting off with a long back story told through inter-titles about the tragic love story of Carmen br br Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies (A band who put the GYP in gypsy) to seduce a Spanish officer so they can pull off their smuggling operation Its a clever Chaplinesque band of criminals the leader of whom Lillas Pastia has spent 50 years learning to steal thinking he might be offered a job in politics br br On a side note Ive seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplins earlier work but probably none quite as overt as in this one Near the beginning of the movie as the band of gypsies are traveling there is a scene where the mules and women are loading and an inter-title explains that the mules are the ones with long ears In case you couldnt tell I guess br br Chaplin plays the part of Don Jose the hapless officer who is to be seduced by Carmen He is described as a brave soldier and lover of women Not exactly a stretch for Chaplin who removed any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms And of course he didnt have to act about being a lover of womenbr br What is different here of course is his polished military uniform and straight-backed disciplinary manner interspersed of course with some of his traditional slap-stick moves He strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff stolid exteriorbr br Soon Carmen enters (Loved by all men under the age of 96) and she immediately begins flirting with Charlie I should mention that for a good majority of the movie it is surprisingly faithful to the original story which was full of jealousy and tragedy Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover able to evoke a jealous passion that Ive never seen from him Theres at least one scene where he is genuinely a little scary br br Chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end And his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasnt very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on probably about five times longer than it was worth Although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop I always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie setsbr br The end of the film is its strongest part It bears striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet but just when you think that Chaplin is going to conduct a major thematic experiment by diverging distantly from his traditional style there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage Chaplin as anything Ive ever seen Nice work!
Being the second last of Chaplins Essanay films CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B Demilles drama with the same title It stands as quite obvious that Demilles acknowledged film didnt impress the comedy king that much which he later admitted in his autobiographybr br Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin He had done several of them already namely HIS PREHISTORIC PAST and HIS NEW JOB and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in films (for instance in A KING IN NEW YORK)br br Chaplin does a very good portrayal of Don José and Edna Purviances is very as good as Carmen Neither act as we are used to; Charlie is not the lovable Tramp and Edna is far from an innocent little woman but that was not Chaplins intentions either A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat odd Chaplin-film very different but includes good material nonethelessbr br The main story is although very differently structured as in the original drama Don José is very much in love with Carmen but is not alone in that field; Carmen Carmen (the) beautiful Carmen (is) loved by all men under 96 but he has the big advantage that he is an officer and there we are; this is the famous story about rivalry love greed and honor seen from a humorous perspective Thanks to Chaplins and Purviances performances and to the wonderful wonderful music by George Bizet which I highly admire this could actually have been a near-comedy masterpiece its time taken into consideration It could have been But unfortunately although it is a good pretty good comedy I dont feel its fair to blame people who claim that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece But its important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent but rather a result of conflicts concerning business When Chaplin refused to re-sign Essanay contract after completing his last film for the company POLICE they took revenge by editing back all the scenes Chaplin originally had edited out from CARMEN Thanks to this the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny and the film turned out to be rather a Ben Turpin-feature --Turpin played Remendados-- than a Chaplin-short Naturally Chaplin was in despair when he discovered what Essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several daysbr br Despite its obvious flaws A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended to Chaplin-fans and to admirers of beautiful music
I just re-watched this thriller one I had previously believed to be one of Hitchs lesser efforts How wrong can you be! Maybe because Im older or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing but now I think its amazing Every bit of suspense is wrung out of the tiniest detail and that final scene on the merry-go-round is just breath-taking! Perfect in every way highly recommended
The first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history(almost as good as the shower scene in Psycho) and the acting by Robert Walker is fantasticA psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murdersThat´s the story and overall this film is very good but theres one problem:why dosen´t Guy Haines go tobr br the cop in the first place45

This movie was fabulous It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film The directing and camera shots are nearly flawless(aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand clearly in slow motion) The plot is well written and realistic It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like thatbr br  I would rate Bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character( of course bates is first) Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac He didnt overact the part which made it believable(much the same how perkins didnt overact his part) Overall this is an excellent movie an absolute must see for any hitchcock fansbr br  br br 
This is another one of Hitchcocks highest rated movies and rightfully so This is a tale of two men who meet on a train and playfully exchange murder fantasies One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to trouble with the law Another fast moving Hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match are worthy of mentioning) Not a movie to be missed- it is a shame that no one will re-release this on DVD with loads of extras- just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD is all thats out there now
Its been said before--Strangers on a Train is Hitchcocks best movie--and hes made so many good ones! Like other Hitchcock Strangers on a Train requires your full attention to really appreciate it but once you canyou will
This is a well-crafted piece from everyones favorite master of suspense As usual the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the films time) I did not find the first part of the film very exciting but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after anotherbr br The only thing I did not like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for the part of Guy Haines Somehow I didnt find him very believable On the other hand Robert Walker shines as sinister bad guy Bruno Anthonybr br Overall I would highly recommend this
Rating: 8 out of 10 Directed by Alfred Hitchcockbr br Tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets the mysterious Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train Soon afterwards Guy finds himself drawn into the psychotic realm of Brunos world br br Guy is separated from his wife and is now involved with a senators daughter Guy is interested in entering into politics after he retires from tennis Bruno wants to kill his own father but doesnt want to do it himselfbr br Bruno proposes that he disposes with Guys wife while Guys part of the deal is to eliminate Brunos father Guy dismisses this idea since he isnt interested in having his troublesome wife killed br br Bruno goes ahead with his half of the proposal While Guy becomes the prime suspect of his wifes murder As law enforcement continues to investigate Guy Bruno continues to torment Guy wanting him to complete the other half of the proposal br br Strangers on a Train has one of the most exciting endings of all Hitchcock movies
Has aged really well - still thrilling and suspenseful today Certainly one of Hitchs best movies Beautifully shot with a great premise for suspense sex-appeal provided by beautiful Ruth Roman Because of the great premise you feel like you have to watch it to the end If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title as the Master of Suspense i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote 5 out of 5
I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM so I had the opportunity to see it Its rather hard to find despite it being a Hitchcock classic Unfortunately it also has its shortcomings some of which Hitchcock has repeated later First off the ending is a little too neat and perfect In the last few scenes until the last five minutes there is an astounding amount of tension; then the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up very unsatisfying The ending is also overly dramatic for a Hitchcock film He is was and always will be the master of suspense why would he stoop to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the ending? Apart from the few shortcomings the film is great The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal ever The theme? Simple You meet a stranger A perfect stranger He offers to kill someone for you you know you have someone you want(if nothing else subconsciously) dead The catch? He asks you to do the same for him will you accept this bizarre yet ingenious arrangement? Youre clear of suspicion and so is he after all neither of you knew the victim And you dont know each other either youre just strangers on a train Brilliant concept and one that just about every single person can relate to The pacing is good you never lose interest or patience The cinematography is good but not nearly as good as it is in other better Hitchcock films The acting is flawless The characters are well-written credible and realistic Hitchcock uses some of the same elements that he often uses; the dominating mother the mothers boy etc The film is very good but it just feels a little watered down It didnt go that famous extra mile that would have made it great It stopped before crossing the line between whats common and whats daring That is the primary reason for the film failing to be great but mainly remains good with potential to be more than that The end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed However everything leading up to the end is very good so the film still gets a deserving 810 Good but not great Any fan of Hitchcock should see it as it is among his best somewhat far down on the list but still there I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock 810
In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime i stumbled upon this film on cable I tried Hitchcock three times before this and never have i felt that the mans work lived up to the praise he had received I always felt he was good not great (from what Ive seen) This was the best of his films Ive seen thusfar Robert Walker is absolutely chilling his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go Even an average performance here damages the overall product My favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain (how exactly does he get his arm down there though?) Bruno is quite a compelling character but i also loved the performance by Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara The rest of the Morton family as well as Guy were a bit dry and boring but she added some flare to the movie as well as having some of the better lines in the scriptbr br Lastly in any suspense movie youre going to live and die by your ending This one holds water unlike a couple other Hitchcock films Ive seen I truly was unsure of how it would end which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited
I knew the premise of this film and obviously I cant miss a good sounding film especially from Master of Suspense director Sir Alfred Hitchcock Basically tennis champ Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets eccentric stranger Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train travelling from Washington to New York Bruno talks about a perfect murder Guy hates his wife and Bruno hates his father so Bruno suggests swapping murders Guy obviously didnt take him seriously until of course when Guys wife Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) is found murdered in an amusement park Guy of course is the chief suspect and Bruno keeps bumping into him reminding him of their plan and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead This murder enquiry and Brunos stalking are threatening his tennis career and his relationship with the daughter of Sen Morton (North by Northwests Leo G Carroll) Anne (Ruth Roman) Bruno realises that Guy wont do his murder so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty Guys monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park After his tennis game Guy and Anne (who obviously found out the murder plan) race to the amusement park to stop Bruno and they have a fight on the speeding out-of-control carousel Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (the directors daughter) as Barbara Morton Marion Lorne as Mrs Anthony Jonathan Hale as Mr Anthony Howard St John as Police Capt Turley and John Brown as Prof Collins and Hitchcocks cameo is the Man boarding train carrying a double bass Some interesting dialogue and character interactions some good suspense moments and of course the unforgettable carousel finale a good classic film It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons the film was number 32 on 100 Years 100 Thrills Very good!
As I looked at this movie once again I think it belongs among Hitchcocks greatest films The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense action and imagery It has the gripping ending the deranged murderer the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances some great on-location shots eg the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York It also has great supporting actors with Hitchs daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies The merry-go-round episode near the end is one of the most nerve-wracking in Hitchcocks body of workbr br Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full film) gives a great performance as the deranged stranger on the train who worms himself into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) Granger plays the nice guy who is caught up in a messy divorce The movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their taxis to board the train Eventually they meet and the story takes over The stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the movie continuesthe stranger becomes a stalker The action shifts from place to place including Washington the fictional small town of Metcalf the Forest Hills tennis championship and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions Towards the end the pace of a tennis game is woven into the plot as they race against time The camera cuts away to the faces of the athletes as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shots When the closely-fought contest is over the climactic chase takes place Hitchcock has a love for trains and it is great to see Penn Station long since gone Trains are featured in the 39 Steps the Lady Vanishes Shadow of a Doubt Spellbound North by Northwest and this movie br br This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense - the 1950s and I am convinced that one day it will be given its due in the Hitchcock hall of fame
One of Alfred Hitchcocks three greatest films along with Psycho and The 39 Steps Strangers On A Train is as brilliantly out-of-control as a merry-go-round in Metcalf and almost as deadly Its the kind of film you have so much fun watching you cant even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breathbr br Top amateur tennis contender Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a singularly weird louche stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train Thanks to the gossip pages Bruno knows all about Guys problems with his no-good wife Miriam and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Brunos father who wants to put Bruno in an institution Guy laughs it off but Bruno aint kidding as Guy finds out to his perilbr br Its a great premise for a murder story and Hitchcock gives Strangers On A Train a run for all its worth with the help of Walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any Hitchcock film including Anthony Perkins in Psycho While Perkins makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain Walker as Anthony is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement parkbr br What drives Bruno? Many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty Guy Yes Bruno lights up the old gay-dar but Guy seems happy enough on loves rebound with socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman) Brunos interest for Guy could just as easily be envy for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home letting Mommy file his nailsbr br Oh I certainly admire people who do things Bruno purrs looking like a cat eyeing a mouse You know it must be pretty exciting to be so importantbr br Later on Bruno calls himself a bum accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him even as he wrecks Guys life with his homicidal meddling Its the ultimate perverse underdogs tale Theres a sense of integrity about Bruno in his dogged dedication which commands our respect and which Hitchcock plays to so brilliantly When Bruno floats away from the scene of his big crime am I the only sick person in this world whos actually happy for him? I think not yet Hitchcock keeps the story on a right-enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen We dont want Bruno to win exactly but we enjoy his élan as he triesbr br Everything else is so perfect or at least close enough to make every shot memorable Hitchcock always managed at least 2-3 good setpiece sequences per movie; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone (20 Big Shows the neon side at the entrance says and they arent kidding) Script camera-work a gripping tennis match Ruth Romans jaw-dropping figure its all too much greatness for one film to contain Even Granger does his callow-youth thing here with more risible plausibility than Gregory Peck ever managedbr br You can call this a clinic in movie-making but clinic sounds too dull Strangers On A Train is good nasty fun all the way through leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along Heck Ill take that ride over again in a second!
Safer indeed Hitchcock is cinemas all time pervert; however we all know his perversions are ours as well so we forgive him And we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ridebr br I saw Hitchs 1953 I Confess a week before this one and I put both in the same category as part of his trademarks These trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsing his artistic veins that spills psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving stains of guilt instead very subtle awareness of feeling ashamebr br The pen is always mightier than the sword and Hitch firmly wrote the most arguable questions with his wrist and then holding firmly with his hands he held cameras that always reflected peoples thirst for blood (most humans have) otherwise comedy wouldnt be mostly a tragic thing and making people laugh wouldnt be so complexbr br Mixing all dark elements of high society with a wealthy psychopath Bruno and an ambitious tennis player wanna be politician Guy the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by Hitch inspiring many filmmakers not only with its plot but with tricky images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmaresbr br Barely perfect!
When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with David O Selznick ended because of this Actually he made some really good films in the period such as NOTORIOUS SPELLBOUND UNDER CAPRICORN ROPE and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked the audiences were turned off by Hitchs attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film) and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of its star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasnt) THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in its favorbr br With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith the story was of how Guy Haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete Bruno is talkative and fawning and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has metif a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space But Bruno knows all about Guys personal problems He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and is in love with Anne Morton daughter of a Senator Bruno knows that Miriam wont divorce her successful celebrity husband Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him Then Bruno mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea The train reaches Guys destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea He just does not realize that the eccentric Bruno is a sociopath and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each others foe!br br Its a wonderfully simple plot actually Bruno of course does kill Miriam but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather Guy is horrified - and worse he finds that he is the police departments number one suspect When Bruno to encourage Guy mentions he has the latters lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site Guy finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno?br br Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each others orbits It is like fate drawing them together Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch with a typical twist makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life One suspects that once Guy too had one but his marriages failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he wasbr br The cast is good too Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death) It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart) As for the ladies Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman) who bears a close resemblance to Miriam and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion She plays this rare role well Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed Other supporting performers Leo G Caroll as the Senator Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Brunos dotty mother and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master
I have never seen this in the theater my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to old VHS tape from rental storebr br Saucey for its time and Im sure the Hayes code was pushed to its limitsbr br Hitchs pallet here is the game play between two combatants And yes if Guy calls the cops on Bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter HELLO people do you always make the best or most logical choice How many times have you been in either persons shoes and made the right choice? For the love of God its called poetic licenseHowever as Guy sees the situation he has found himself in he takes it upon himself to rectify it He does not solicit help nor does he lie to his would be new wife Her defense of him sets off the final show down with Bruno feeling he has one more card to playbr br For the cop shot-ting an innocent person in pre-cam corder days and before rules of engagement this type of thing did happen In the post Rodney King world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man If you havent seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior your blind or have an application pending for the academenybr br Back to the moviebr br Go watch it with Try and wear a post WWII filter and pretend your seeing a great suspense movie like many did for the first time back then and sure its been copied since but your looking at one of the source of inspiration for many that followed
In Alfred Hitchcocks adaptation of Patricia Highsmiths Strangers On A Train Guy Haines (Farley Granger)and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker)meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders The rather pushy Anthony suggests that he could murder Haines unfaithful wife and Haines could murder Anthonys domineering father The lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved The tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going Haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious Complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines wife in an amusement park and then pursues Haines to keep his side of the bargainbr br The differences between the two men are clear from the start Haines is a professional tennis player respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas Anthonys life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling Haines is in a relationship with a Senators daughter who he wants to marry Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on Haines part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career The character differences are also reinforced visually Anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called Pluto whereas Haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera anglesbr br There are some striking visual sequences such as:- br br (1) The murder of Haines wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from Anthonybr br (2) The depiction of Anthony alone dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white Jefferson Memorial buildingbr br (3) The occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison following the action whilst one head (Anthonys) chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at Hainesbr br (4)The scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularlybr br Frequent use is made of doubles throughout the story for example Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train As the train pulls out of the station there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskies The Hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass Haines feels double crossed when his wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce Haines wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends When Anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses Anthony later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the Senators younger daughter who he sees as a double for Haines wife Anthony also feels double crossed when Haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder When Haines is travelling alone in a train going to Metcalf he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and Anthony hadbr br The action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the Senators younger daughter) are particularly powerful
In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock its apparent that Big Als fear from the police dates back to his childhood His father sent him to the police station carrying a note The note said: Hes been naughty imprison him for an hour The policemen obliged and ever since Hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the policebr br Strangers on a Train is probably one of the best in his wrongly-accused series The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel Thats the same author who wrote the Ripley series She was always fascinated by smart criminalsbr br Hitchcocks opening is very strong and takes you immediately to the protagonists: Guy Haines a famous tennis player and Bruno Anthony the aspiring criminal The two guys share a chemistry which in that day and age was probably a lot more than what the audience could chew Bruno tries to persuade Guy that they could commit the perfect murder (leaving no clues) if they switch victims Bruno will kill Guys wife who wouldnt give him a divorce and Guy would kill Brunos father The motives are respectively love and moneybr br Brunos performance is meant to be seductive and homoerotic This is not something that was done by accident In fact Hitchcock edited two versions of the movie: one US one UK In the US version the volume of Brunos seductiveness was turned down quite a bitbr br Strangers on a Train is a very deep movie but more importantly this is another excellent Hitchcock thriller An excellent example of a thrilling scene is when Guy is climbing the steps up to Brunos father room Hitchcock reasoned that the audiences attention needed to be distracted at this point so that they dont figure out what Guy will find in the room Hitch treats us to a HUGE menacing dog at the top of the stairs which provided the needed distractionbr br The most famous shot in the movie occurs during a tennis match Bruno has been continuously stalking Guy so that Guy will fulfil his end of the bargain (kill his father) When Guy looks at the audience all the heads are swiveling back and forth All except one - Brunos Hes looking straight at Guy with an ill-get-you smilebr br The ending is another example of suspense Both men fight for one key piece of evidence on a merry-go-round thats rotating at mad speed A worker is crawling under it so he could get to the controls When we finally get off this ride and the movie ends with Guy proving his innocence we are left exhausted and nail-less (for those of us still biting our nails!)br br Strangers on a Train is easily one of Hitchcocks best wrongly accused movies Some credit him with one of the best villains (Bruno) as well All in all the movie might appear somewhat dated but thats a lesson in thriller-making from the master himself I wont turn down Leonardo if he came to teach me Renaissance painting so neither should youbr br  Review posted at FilmDailiescom
This is one of Alfred Hitchcocks best films and one of his most underrated I believe it certainly exceeds a Psycho or The Birds for technical artistry and brilliance It is a macabre tense darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some timebr br Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcocks most memorable villains as the father-hating mother-fixated (but arent most of Hitchcocks villains mummys boys?) Bruno It is a disturbing stunning performance that illuminates the whole film His character is obsessive apparently homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how he is described as European) strangely charming and dangerous to cross Farley Granger certainly knows this as he becomes entangled in Brunos sordid web after the pair meet on a train Bruno knowing some inside information on Guys affairs proposes the two swap murders for each others benefit Walker will kill Grangers slutty conniving wife who is inhibiting his marriage to beautiful Anne whilst Granger will murder Brunos father who he so intensely hates Everyones happy right? A win-win as Bruno asserts? Wrong Granger forgets about the indecent proposal but an obsessed Walker doesnt He commits his murder and is determined to hound Granger until he completes his side of the bargain too Strangers becomes a riveting suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse in Hitchs capable handsbr br Hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes We have the whore Miriam Grangers estranged wife pregnant to another man She lasciviously slurps a phallic ice-cream cone whilst openly eating up Bruno with her eyes Barbara Morton Annes sister is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks youll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the 50s Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock ever made and it is typical to a Hitch film subtly sexual in detailbr br This fits into the film-noir category with its focus on murder lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography Walkers nut is one for the ages and Granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two and I never believed her relationship with Granger Still the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the BEST American films ever madebr br Just look at what Hitch does here- the originality the technical skill We see the murder of Miriam reflected in her shattered glasses A game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling intense scenes youll ever see A innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences A young boys balloon is popped callously by Walker (Hitch obviously liked what he saw in The Third Man!)Childrens delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming fast-paced terror Hitch subverts normal everyday events like no otherbr br The camera-work here is among the best ever seen in a Hitchcock film and the premise is to-die-for Its slick oozes sophistication and devilish charm The cross-cutting between Walker and Grangers characters is magnificent- Grangers do-or-die tennis match is just as vital as villain Walkers rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain Hitch again build his villain into a nasty repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming (Did anyone else find him strangely attractive more so than Granger?) piece of work- we are just as tense as Walker in our hope that he can get the lighter out of the drain We need him to anyway He holds the key to the storybr br Youll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this filmbr br Amazingbr br 1010
Well this is about as good as they come There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a compulsive technician -- or was he really deep Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean but its legitimate to ask if at his best he could not have been all three things at oncebr br In this one he seems to be about at his peak Hardly anything in it is accidental It abounds with doubt ambiguity and wit And the story is engrossing Patricia Highsmith apparently having complexes similar to Hitchcocks ownbr br Im sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so I wont bother going into it Ill just point out five on screen incidents that Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible forbr br Bruno Antony (Walker) has followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her Shes noticed his attention and is innocently flattered by itbr br 1 Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through The Tunnel of Love and then to an island in the center of the lake Walker is right behind them smiling in his boat -- Pluto Pluto Its not an allusion to the Walt Disney cartoon character Its a reference to Pluto also called Hades a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology This tiny touch cant be an accident And the underworld that Walker represents is not just a literal hell but the underworld of the human mind I hate to say hes a Jungian shadow but thats what he is (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive at the time of its release -- but probably not) 2 Now this is a deadly serious sequence right? Walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he doesnt even know Imagine the way this would have been laid out by most directors A night-time stalking through a crowded carnival stealing from shadow to shadow the killer peering from behind the canvas walls and so forth What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first comes through the gates concentrating on his victim a little boy in a cowboy suit holding a balloon runs up and shouts Bang! Bang! Youre dead! Walker jerks his head back in surprise and glares down indignantly at the kid And when the kid starts to walk away Walker darts his cigarette at the balloon and pops it then continues his pursuit without another glance Thats one way Hitchcock treats impending doombr br 3 The famous strangling reflected in the fallen eyeglasses which has been aped innumerable timesbr br 4 Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound with a big mallet sending a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to measure the strength of your blow One of her boyfriend whams it and the puck doesnt reach the bell at the top Under Miriams delighted and admiring gaze Walker smiles and rubs his hands together then picks up the mallet slams it down and the puck bangs against the bell Shes thrilled He puts the mallet down looks at her grins and WAGGLES HIS EYEBROWS at her like a ten-year-old showoff! 5 After the discovery of Miriams body while whistles blow and people shout Walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the curb Walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads him across the intersection gravely holding up his hand to stop the traffic A macabre jokebr br These incidents and others all take place during the ten or fifteen-minutes of the carnival visit (Robert Walkers performance is exceptional throughout) Its essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish (Cf: Ride the Pink Horse) But the menace of the scene is undercut by Hitchcocks insistence on irony and distance None of the familiar noir techniques are employed Theres nothing really creepy about it And the murder itself is hardly a savage one I dont think that any director other than Hitchcock would have handled it the way he did It would have been all menace and shadows hiding places abortive attempts scowls instead of grinsbr br Not that its an entirely flawless movie A flawless movie is not yet with us Some of the middle section is a bit slow going and Farley Granger although a nice guy is stolid dull and rather stupid His new girl friend is just dullbr br Hitchcock was to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly seriousness in The Wrong Man Im not sure Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt The latter was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education Original sin -- youre BORN with it -- and all that In filmed interviews he always glibly explained away his fear of the police and of authorities generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo Were justified in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a screen memory I hope you get the pun I know I know Its strained and inept but I spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up
Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry It is likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock was always attempting to push the envelope and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper more poignant motive on his mind Strangers on a Train one of Hitchcocks first and more underrated hits is a perfect example of these traits - an entertaining and suspenseful story even when viewed over 50 years later yes but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique br br Arguably one of the pioneering suspense thrillers Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 (if perhaps slightly less shocking) The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick careful editing are what really make the film stand out drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audiences focus even in slower scenes If there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments; every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion Sadly enough there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing - Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the films most tense and engaging scene These are only brief moments but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar filmbr br But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clichée after clichée its wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original Sure its fairly straightforward but the concept of swapping murders is simply one that would not fly in films of todays day and age which makes it all the more entertaining to watch; the films brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while One cant help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in humanitys heart demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder as well as Brunos own cavalier attitude towards death Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour (Bruno popping a childs balloon with his cigarette is priceless) and irony shooting suspenseful scenes in happy easy-going environments such as the iconic carnival scenes to create an even more eerie atmosphere This may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable br br The antagonistic figure of Bruno (essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker sadly in his last film role but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable as the character is a marvel to behold Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment Bruno is a calm controlled psychotic mess He speaks of murder in such an offhand tone yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people Bruno could seem to represent the Id as Freud would put it the inner darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure Guy Haines and how bland and uninteresting he seems almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing br br Yet despite this implied message Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome Its a testament to actor Farley Grangers talent that despite Robert Walkers villain easily stealing the show Grangers hero still comes across as sympathetic still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character Superb support is given by Ruth Roman who manages to overcome the clichée and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guys horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife and Patricia Hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than being simply the directors daughter would imply The superb cast (headed by a simply wonderful Walker) really bring the film to life adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcocks breathtaking stylistics br br All in all Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers but its still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems considering it was released half a century ago Once again Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique and the films surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience! br br -910
I have used this movie in my college Ethics courses for over 10 years (also Woody Allens Crimes and Misdemeanors--another terrific multi-leveled ethical study) br br Its fiction I dont focus too much on the unrealistic features of Strangers because all fictional films are obviously false on many levels I love the film as gallows comedy tautly told with many ironic twists and visual pleasures--even if its unbelievable The story is told so well that I dont even think of criticizing its plausibility (although I must confess that the tennis match seems the weakest part to me--too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition)br br Some problems presented in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and ethical discussion:br br 1 Ethical Passivity: some weaknesses of the Guy character are intended by Hitchcock A primary ethical insight of the film is the danger of inability to articulate ones moral positions Guy is unable to effectively block Brunos crazy proposals at the start An interesting question is why and how does Guy behave so passively ineffectively? A possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process br br 2 Miscommunication: Guy commits another failure at the start: on the train to get away quickly he agrees that Brunos ideas are all good But Guys literal meaning is opposite to his inflected sarcastic meaning Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss-cross murders Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement To some extent near the beginning Bruno may be partially pretending that an agreement has been struck to draw Guy further into a web of complicity Bruno is manipulating Guy; Guys linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno a chance to put an ethical stranglehold on Guy Bruno manipulating Guy may also take on other meanings    br br 3 Secrecy: Some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno It seems at first ridiculous especially since Guy appears obviously heterosexual in his relationships with Miriam and Anne However remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women Guy appears (stereotypically--its 1951 remember) effeminate especially in relationship to Bruno Guy the strong athlete is weak on the inside Bruno is also conflicted (playing against himself) appearing facially and physically strong at first but then displaying some effeminate traits (Brunos fashion and footwork; his gushing emotionally to Guy in different situations; his receiving a manicure from his doting mother; Bruno kissing and desperately fondling his mothers hand; other more subtle gay stereotypes that hold cryptic meaning from Hitchcocks point of view) I wish I could hear Hitchcock clarify his intended meanings herebr br 4 Dishonesty and Distrust: Guy makes some colossal blunders in hiding truths about Bruno from family and from police Guy fails to fully comprehend that admitting fault quickly may be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession Again Guy is driven by passivity insecurity fear--and perhaps a self-hate that is closer to Brunos own self-loathing than we care to see or to admit Both Guy and Bruno act out their own parables of impotencebr br 5 Lack of Evidence: Guy feels a problem mustering the evidence to acquit himself While quickly going to the police would solve a huge problem Guy traps himself with his own doubts and insecurities: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on Guys behalf; the obsessive need to appear politically pristine; and other personality factors that cause Guy to feel defenseless He is as dysfunctional as Bruno--just not as dangerous (yet one could partially blame Guy for Miriams murder)br br 6 Disease and Mental Disorder: an interesting question is how legally responsible is Bruno for the murders? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath the more guilty Guy may be as someone healthy who failed to stand up and morally act to prevent the crimes Guys failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and death ensues One could argue that more than one crime is committed and that Guy is an emotionally hobbled accomplicebr br These and many other features of the film make Strangers on a Train a gem of a morality play a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections
This is such a revered and studied film a classic among Hitchcocks many it takes no cajoling to want to watch it again Yet you think: can it hold up even when the huge (and clever and amazing) trick of the plot is no surprise?br br Yesbr br And for starters there is the start a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story the gist of it Two taxis two men shown with their shoes each walking onto the train sitting then across from each other and oops a mistake a little nudge and the conversation begins and we see the men themselves They are interchangeable br br The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock as it is in many horror and suspense films-- cheery and light We know entering the film however that this wont be the case so already we are worried What after all is about to go wrong?br br A lot In truly Hitchcock fashion it is a purely innocent man (nearly always a man) who faces injustice who is trapped by circumstance threatening what is most valuable to him The innocent in this case tennis player Guy Haynes is played with an innocence that is believable--his collegiate politeness in that first scene for example as he realizes the other man is a little cuckoo is just what you or I might do The not-so-innocent man is the self- absorbed and scarily intelligent spoiled child Bruno Anthony played with utter brilliance by Robert Walker (This uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock wacko played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho) So from scene one on the train (and the train really gorgeous!) we have the two leads and we have the mind-blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith who also wrote the books behind the two Mr Ripley movies And it doesnt hurt that the screenplay was co- written by Raymond Chandler himself who knows something about economy and clever dialog And crimebr br And of course there is more than just the first scene What to note? Well that smarty of a senators daughter (I thought she was terrific) is Hitchcocks daughter Patricia who is still with us (as of 2009; she also had a role in Psycho) And there is a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film--the tennis courts in the Hamptons known to us as the site of the US Open The fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady montage building up the suspense by making it surreal The fear gets positively fattening with the laughing children and the old man crawling underneath it all And when it collapses in a crash--thats all backprojected on a set one of the more naturalistic uses by a director known for not worrying about the realism of his back projectionsbr br The photography is that perfect Hollywood stunning without becoming so stylized (as in some noir films) that it is an object in its own right Look again at the first scene or the shooting (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder This is sophisticated construction When we are not completely surprised that its Bruno in the bed that only proves that the director has us on our toes Something unexpected is always expectedbr br Are there glitches? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falseness you can accept (or embrace) as beautiful style The scene where Bruno is choking the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman played by Norma Varden is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away) and marred by his looking at the senators daughter and being triggered into a deadly trance by her glasses and her resemblance to his earlier victim This is a mid-20th Century idea of psychology that intrudes on many of Hitchcocks efforts (The end of Psycho for starters)br br The Wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the movie from the main characters to the murder victim and the senators daughter This echoes in lots of little ways--two men trail him to the tennis court two men accompany the victim to the amusement park and so on There can be too much made of this but it does supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness Dont forget there are meant to be two murders--it is the lack of the second murder the inability to create a doubling in that case that causes Bruno to unravelbr br Walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot and just afterwards he died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts Though he appeared in other films Strangers on a Train is easily his tour-de- force Farley Granger had a long career that never quite saw him break into true stardom though his style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works especially in They Live by Night br br And if you watch this one for the first or third time do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowds heads all move back and forth in unison-- except for Brunos He is staring out without moving his head straight at us As the trailer for the movie says after this movie you wont be talking to strangers on a train
br br Lets swap Murders- your wife my father- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey Guy a solid respectable tennis player whose problem is that his wife the flirtatious Miriam wont divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne laughs the whole conversation off as a joke The following week he isnt laughing any more In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her As he does her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses Cold hearted and amoral Bruno his part of the deal completed approaches an appalled Guy expecting even pressuring him into doing his bit Matters are not helped when Annes precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting Guy of Miriams murder So accused of a murder he didnt commit and expected to commit another what is Guy going to do? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature - and this Hitchcock does to perfection
In Strangers On A Train its obvious from the start that playboy wastrel Robert Walker has singled out Farley Granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders Grangers a semi-public figure hes a tennis pro but not an especially high one High enough however for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Romanbr br So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them complete strangers did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise Though Granger is repulsed by the idea one of the beautiful things about this film is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger just might submit to temptationbr br In fact when Walker kills Laura Elliot Grangers wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man he expects that Granger will in turn murder Walkers father so that Walker can inherit his estate Today Walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at thatbr br Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role ironically in his last complete film Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished Hitchcock does not do too bad by Farley Granger either br br Of course when Granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him the tension Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing first in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and waylay Walker before he plants evidence convicting Granger at the crime scene And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Grangerbr br Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his best it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing
Strangers on a Train was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing I finally watched it a few weeks ago and as always with any Hitchcock movie it not only stood up to the test of time it far surpassed most thrillers being made today You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bonts Speed Of course Strangers is over forty years older than Speed and contains no modern special effects but the visceral thrill is there - Hitchcock was a true geniusbr br The not-so-subtle gay side of Bruno (Robert Walker in an amazing performance) has taken form in many other psycho-stalker-figures in future movies Consider him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in Single White Female He knows about Guy before he even meets him on the train - we almost get the feeling their contact isnt incidental - and is soon entirely obsessed with himbr br Hitchcock loved the Oedipial elements in his movies (also see Psycho for more blatant undertones) and theres a lot of that here Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother His effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951 when gays were not allowed to be portrayed on the screen - yet Hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see Bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non-masculine robe flirting with Guy and responding to his motherbr br The deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller than you can return to again and again - unfortunately its being remade as a big-budget Hollywood production but after seeing the original I honestly cant imagine anything surpassing the sheer white-knuckle thrills of this movie
Even though some unrealistic things happen at the end (ie a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry-go-round where any number of innocent could be killed) this still was an intense enjoyable thriller one of Alfred Hitchcocks better films Robert Walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times His co-star in here Farley Granger is okay but is no match for Walker either in acting or in the characters they play Its the typical Hitchcock film with some strange camera angles immoral themes innocent man gets in trouble etc Unlike a lot of his other films I thought this one was a fast-moving story with a very few dull spots Being an ex-tennis player I enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies Hitchcocks real-life daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here She didnt just get the job because of her dad; she can act Also of note: the DVD has both the British and American versions and there were some differences in the story This is a classic film that is still referred to in modern-day films even comedies such as Throw Momma Off The Train
Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigos and the Psychos is this film; Strangers on a Train the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made The story follows Guy Haines a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senators daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife One day on the way to see his wife he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall; and one that could ultimately cost him his lifebr br The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinemas most intriguing and thought provoking of all time What if two people swapped murders thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant? Could this truly be the perfect murder? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any normal everyday person Everyone has someone theyd like to get rid of so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his? The chances of it happening are unlikely but its the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train; and in this situation anyone could br br Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker? The man was simply born for the part He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in The character of Bruno is a madman but hes not a lunatic; hes a calculating conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable His performance is extremely malevolent and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality Unfortunately Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train and I believe that is a great loss to cinema Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger Granger never really impresses that much but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; and that is how it should be Ruth Roman is Guys wife to be She isnt really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she makes the best of what she has Alfred Hitchcocks daughter Patricia takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara the sister of Guys fiancé She is suitably lovely in this role and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is inbr br Alfred Hitchcocks direction is always sublime and it is very much so in this film There is one shot in particular that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses This is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene Hitchcocks direction is moody throughout and very much complies with the film noir style The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting and I dont think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film Its truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie; but it works There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time and the reason for that is that he doesnt only use the script to tell the films story but he also uses to camera to do so as well Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking and is sure to delight any fan of cinema A masterpiece
One would have expected Hitchcocks return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution Surely few expected his most riotous unrestrained film a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy exciting suspense mocking manipulation and astonishing flights of fancy But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAINbr br What is remarkable is how much Brunos transgression disrupts the world of the film Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life and hence the society he represents or is eager to join Guy is the archetypal American the working-class boy made good moving in influential circles athletic successful handsome Bruno is his destructive opposite gay decadent European (he lives off his father in a Big House and just lounges about dreaming of murder) Brunos life is one of repetition circularity whereas Guy moves straight ahead It is Brunos achievement to move Guy into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force HIM to transgress (break the law hope for murder (Brunos))br br Bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy All the authority figures in the film are criticised - Brunos father a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in Aunt Claras paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Annas incredibly Machiavellian self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken Far from being the mother-hater of legend Hitch as Robin Wood perceived is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchybr br Brunos transgression turns the world topsy-turvy This is Hitchs most surreal film Whenever Guy is in his plot he is filmed straight with conventionally romantic music But whenever Bruno intrudes the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque bizarre much more fun This is Hitchs first truly American film revelling in the primitive detritus of Americana Grown men puncture little boys balloons or try to throw them off merry-go-rounds Distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains Elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees Washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky like a haunting Dali painting There is one of the greatest and funniest scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless smiling Bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match an image worthy of Magritte Just look at any scene with Bruno in it and watch it derail into the bizarrebr br Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (Hitch had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in more staid environs: Washington will never look the same again STRANGERS is also VERTIGO notwithstanding Hitchs most overtly sexual film - as well as the phalluses there is the sustained homoeroticism the remarkable play with riding horses; the gobsmacking fellatio joke when Hitchs daughter spills powder over the policemanbr br And yet Hitch doesnt stint on good old suspense In the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates and Hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification willing Bruno into murder There is a hilariously painful sequence where Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame Guy down a drain The gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience I was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny slightly disturbing and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success And Hitch milks it with callous glee - listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions and kick yourself for taking it all so seriouslybr br STRANGERS is one of Hitchs five best films and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema The dialogue is so strange and brilliant I cant believe it wasnt written by Chandler Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imp standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts Guy The fairground finale is a remarkable dizzying fusion of exciting tense set-piece black comedy and symbolic site If Brunos final words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic precepts Hitch is supposed to embody: compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS) we applaud his integrity infinitely preferable to Guys debased serving of self
Cam Archers lyrical Bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt) that is more vibe than narrative Caught somewhere between documentary and dream Bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of early Todd Haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of Gus van Sant With grit glamour and heartbreak its kinda like the movie equivalent of Sonic Youth playing bubblegum pop
Beautifulthat one word pretty much sums up this whole film Everything from the cinematography the directing the actingbrilliant At any point of the film you can pause it and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or artsy fartsy as some people would say I assure you that after one viewing Bobbycrush will be stuck in your head I know this from first hand experience Even the soundtrack is great It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film Be thankful that Cam Archer exists in this world We need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) imagery
Dylan and Bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are But Dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside Bobby knows that hes not interested in girls and misses what he had with Dylan br br Told as part cheesy 80s pop video part home movie part video recollection this film tells a confusing and sad but all too often true story that will hit home with many that see it br br This film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true chord with me but I wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note Yes we all love and lose even when we are young but theres always tomorrow especially when we are young
Very enjoyable 50s Western I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fansbr br Mostly Victor Matures movie and quite well done in my estimationbr br Hes a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions They all joined as scouts after their lossbr br Victor has set his eyes on the Colonels wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulationsbr br Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other charactersbr br 50s Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction A Western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again One to enjoy Gave it a 7 rating Likely 68 worthy but films like these become more precious over timebr br For film-noir fansThe Big Steal They Live By Night Side Street are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed Bought and viewed Noir seems to resemble Westerns in a way Some long ago and never forever
I enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline All the main characters are well cast True John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well but Victor Mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling Tarzan of sorts Reminds me of his film role as Samson another difficult but not impossible man to tamebr br The mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts This story supposedly takes place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene(probably Mt Lassen) the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the Cascades as we never see any other civilians However there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort is the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in Wyoming and Montana Fort Laramie(eastern Wyoming)is mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort The plains tribe of Assiniboines is mentioning as joining Red Cloud This aspect of the story then bears a general resemblance to historical factbr br It may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of John Fords Fort Apache In both cases we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with Native American problems He underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career In both films he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy Also in common the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do In both films we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commanders heart and a subordinate which the commander does everything to squelch Clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completionbr br I also see certain resemblances with The Misfits The soldiers as a whole including the commander are misfits of a sort((as one of them admits): mostly they have problems or are raw recruits with no experience fighting Native Americans The commanders wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort thus is inherently a misfit with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army The trappers in turn are also misfits not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army-generated antagonism by Red Cloud br br Finally we can also compare this story with Anthony Manns later film The Far Country starring Jimmy Stewart In Stewarts case he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end But Matures character doesnt come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss Red Cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate Besides he has an obsession with the Commanders wife
Victor Mature as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper may be on the poster but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to get cut to ribbons by Confederate artillery at Shiloh and is sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence has the most interesting part married to a young and hard to recognize at first Anne Bancroft The uncivilized Mature lusts for the colonels wife giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another mans wife at one point by James Whitmore who plays Matures older and wiser mountain man father figure Directed by Anthony Mann this film is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart but even so you really dont need the Indian menace to make this a film worth seeing although Preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the Indians under submission in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout
this is another good westernwhich i enjoyedits not an epic or anythingbut it is good for what it isit about 3 fur trappersled by a men named Jedwho is crude and uncivilizedJed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and Indian bandwho resent the Americans on their landand want to take it backthats the gist of the storywhat follows is actionexcitementeven a bit of humourand forbidden romanceone of Jeds friendsGusreminded me a lot of the character Quint(played by Robert Shaw)in the movie Jawsthey both have that crustygruff demeanoranywayif youre a western fanyou should find lots to like about this particular entryi think it deserves a 710
One of the more obscure of Anthony Manns Westerns The Last Frontier was also his only cavalry Western (aside from one brief episode in Winchester 73) though naturally he focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a Fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals Set not in his beloved high country but in the foothills and forests its a much more cynical view of life of the frontier in many ways his Fort Apache without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost is made up of misfits failures cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors badly led while the Civil War takes priority and all the best the army has to offerbr br Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free trappers who find civilisation creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and packhorses by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the Cavalry into their territory Rather than blame the Indians for their losses they decide its the armys fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead But despite the best efforts of Guy Madisons amiable and competent acting commander to bring Mature into the 19th Century and make him fit to wear the uniform the arrival of Robert Prestons humiliated Colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost  and Matures clumsy infatuation with the Colonels wife (Anne Bancroft too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman whos tired of being saved by men who think they know whats best for her)  soon drive matters into much darker territory Its not long before some of the soldiers are busily planning on killing each other both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them: little wonder that at one point Mature throws away the bluecoat he has long coveted in disgust screaming I would have died for this but its nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag! The Stallone of his day Mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director This is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part perversely enough as a simple man  well-meaning but drunk violent uneducated and with a unsubtle almost childlike lust for life the part seems designed with Burt Lancaster in mind with some striking similarities to his character in The Kentuckian But Robert Prestons Ahab-like Colonel is clearly the best role determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal Civil War engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board In his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption driven as much by his sense of shame at his wifes sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he regards as his inferiors Hes beyond salvation but theres still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity  he genuinely admires Madisons courage in making a futile attempt to get Prestons orders countermanded by their superiors  fatally skewed though it isbr br Like its hero the film is a little rough around the edges (and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any Western) but that only tends to make it more interesting and there are plenty of Manns typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive Unfortunately the deficiencies of the early CinemaScope lenses are very apparent in Columbias DVD with the image often dark (255:1 CinemaScope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early Scope films show a lot of trial-and-error) and grainy
br br The Last Frontier is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed (Victor Mature) Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison) Colonel Marston(Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston colonels wife (Anne Bancroft) Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians Jed Gus and Mungo adjust to living the civilized life within a fort on the edge of the last frontier Jed who has been raised by Gus both inspires and looks up to the older Gus and Mungo and has an especially difficult time dealing with civilization His real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonels wife Corrina Colonel Marstonis a reckless man who endangers every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent Corrina a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is Caught in the middle is Captain Riordon a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonels recklessness br br What makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of The Last Frontier are EXACTLY the same elements (forget the insipid title and dated music)br br First the screenplay Almost all of the subplots (particularly the reckless Colonel) have been done better elsewhere but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity Just when you THINK you know what is going to happen next this one takes off in a DIFFERENT direction POSSIBLE SPOILER: The Last Frontier being a Production Code movie (back in the day the word virgin was taboo) its very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature tolerant manner I expected either Jed or the colonels wife to reap some retribution for their sin I was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didnt exploit that expectation to create a less predictable endingbr br Second the casting Mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of Jed the wild-eyed innocent raised in the woods James Whitmore who plays Gus the man who raised Jed is actually five years younger than Mature Nevertheless Mature is very endearing playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid Although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time (most notably Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas) none could have played Jed better Preston (also Matures junior) plays Colonel Marston missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man However Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in Marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonels rank Bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as Corrina Bancrofts dark hair has been died blonde and this achieves the same effect as it did for Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands) and Christina Ricci (Sleepy Hollow) That is I felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why; I believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades Further Bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness (here the blonde hair softens her up a bit though) This enables the 24 year old Bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old Mature and the 37 year old Preston; yep she could be a colonels wife Madison walks a careful balancing act as Riordan handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialoguePlaying a role similar to that of John Wayne in Fort Apache Madison does a more skillful job at itbr br This movie has a Silverado type camaraderie That alone makes it worth seeing It also has memorable performances beautiful scenerary and great action and direction I just hope a letterbox version is available (many have been lost) because this movie takes full advantage of that format
Ordinarily Anthony Mann made westerns with the big guys - James Stewart Gary Cooper Henry Fonda    the A list cowboy stars But in this B+ film he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western The main character played by Victor Mature is a trapper mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men Not here For once a true mountain man - vulgar crude animalistic - is the central figure and its something to see giving Mature one of his better later roles The real acting chops are provided by Robert Preston excellent as a self-absorbed Custer type cavalry commander and James Whitmore the poor mans Spencer Tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile Indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officers wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of Matures grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that shes attracted to him Rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache The battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format Good show and underrated movie all around
A very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution Ian McShane is right at home playing the soul loving DJ who gets canned because he wont  go along with the program  and sets out to let the world know what theyre missing The supporting cast is great as well and the music is the Soul of the film I just wish that the film would be released so that I could get a copy of this for my film library
The sort of little film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore Sort of a soul version of the more well-known The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as Isaac Hayes as well as acting stalwarts Taurean Blacque Derrick OConnor and Antonio Fargas Not meant to be an epic by any means this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold
Better than average World War II-era who-dun-it featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight Crime Doctors Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems The link to courage is not particularly clearbr br This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but Dr Ordway labels murder Hillary Brooke plays the part of widow Kathleen Carson who is involved with Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage As a mystery novelist Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor as is Lloyd Corrigan as an aficionado in crimebr br Spooky houses with creaking doors caskets in the cellar and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good Direction production design and photography stand out The exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average B detective thrillerbr br Strongly recommended
Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [#410] with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid Spanish American backdrops and sets And a more off-the-wall storyline too!br br A man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party The Crime Doctor is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over for one of them did the deed Was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife the 3rd wife and rich widow Hilary Brooke the dancing brother and sister vampires the intense young man the eccentric cabinet maker Lloyd Corrigan on loan from Boston Blackie the irreplaceable butler or odds-on Jerome Cowan? Police Inspector Emory Parnell had his work cut out but Warner Baxter as Ordway was as unflappable as ever in working it all out One of the goofs listed on the IMDb is wrong: On breaking into the murder room Ordway says Right through the centre of the forehead and Cowan replies He didnt miss this time Favorite bits: Baxter and Cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party; The scene where the Bragas place of repose is seemingly rumbled The plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of Monogram but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldnt do either!br br Well worth a watch if you already like the genre you wont be disappointed unless you really dont like the genre
I saw this on TCM recently and through the IMDb I found that there were seven Crime Doctor movies with Warner Baxter as the psychiatrist-detective Baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier Not noir and a bit campy today the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural The plot black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the Mr Moto and Charlie Chan series There are subplots unexpected twists and appearances by a number of B movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately (none ever made it to the A status) It is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutesbr br I would love to see a boxed DVD series of these films
Note: After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the original film My mistake I thought IMDb for a database for movies not TV shows But since most people will look up this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM which strangely is the name this film is listed under on IMDb Ill leave this comment herebr br Maybe I missed something but when I read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the CBS series -- which must have been loosely based on this film I did not see the TV series and I might like it or not but one thing I am sure is that it is very different than this film This film is NOT like a TV show at all and Whoopie Goldberg is not in it or any other famous Hollywood stars (other than Jack Palance who was very charming in his role)br br This is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks outside the box It is not at all like a Hollywood formula movie which is probably why the (whats a nice word for idiots?) who decide to market movies or not decided not to market this onebr br First of all this movie captured my heart and imagination from the get-go From the music (which is just part of the time so you cant really call it a musical) to the cinematography to the really cool storybr br A German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and quite plump) gets in an argument with the other German or Bavarian man with whom she is traveling through the California desert with and parts ways with him --he taking off in the car and she left to fend for herself on a deserted and desert-like highway out in the middle of nowherebr br She finds the small and dilapidated but charming Bagdad Cafe in Bagdad California and checks in The rest of the story is magic I dont want to try to describe this film because I want you to enjoy every surprisebr br Warning: If you are a racist or have something against big women you will not like this movie as the main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have large roles and are included as part of the mix without any racism involvedbr br I gave this film a 10 for orginality entertainment and sheer delightfulness
You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940sbr br On top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags the plot is as far-fetched as the tales The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it But then thats how unrealistic the comedy isbr br But--if youre a true Red Skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the 40s--you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting him Ann Rutherford and Virginia Grey do nicely as his love interest and Conrad Veidt as always makes an interesting villain One of his more amusing moments is his reaction to Skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans I never knew that he muses impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introducedbr br All in all typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are Not always easy for a discriminating viewer as many of them simply fall flat the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one-liners has simply worn off
Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as The Fox in Whistling in the Dark also starring Ann Rutherford Conrad Veidt Eve Arden Virgina Grey and Rags Ragland Wally Benton aka The Fox finds his plans to marry his fiancé Carol (Rutherford) thwarted when hes kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult (Veidt) Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult The Silver Haven is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old womans nephew who is going to be living off of the interest He wants Wally to devise a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the airplane en route to meet with his attorney For backup and because hes not sure which one is Wallys fiancé Jones kidnaps Carol and also the radio sponsors daughter (Grey)br br This to me anyway is a superior film to the second entry in this series Whistling in Dixie The plot is better the cast is better there is less slapstick and fewer corny jokes Skelton when hes not making faces and rolling his eyes is quite amiable and Rutherford is very good Veidt always played these evil men to perfection Eve Arden is Wallys agent who arranges a date for him and Grey to make sure his contract is renewed I had only seen Grey in films from the 1950s onward She was always a good-looking woman but who knew she was such a knockout in the 30s and 40s? This is a fun film with a neat cast
There are 3 of these movies all similarly crafted and each extremely amusing Red plays radio sleuth Wally Benton aka The Fox who gets wrangled into solving real life crimes along with his fiance played by your typical wartime girl next door looker Ann Rutherford Many of the one-liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s which I anticipated But just as many actually made me laugh out loud which was unexpected to say the least Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence surprising I say because I grew up with a much older version of the man whos charm really didnt play well in my formidable years I have to give these movies the go ahead though -if your in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare I almost threw in light hearted but in truth people get wasted and beaten up and dare i say it the suspense at times is well above average As with most movies from this era it gets a PI (politically incorrect) rating for reasons you can well imagine Wartime is funny that way I guess and so then again are these movies Watch one watch them all
Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton who plays The Fox on a radio show He writes the murder mysteries and as The Fox solves them Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone He kidnaps Benton his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey) He tells Benton to write out the perfect murderor his girlfriends get itbr br Very funny and enjoyable movie Fast-moving (its only 77 minutes) a good script and perfect casting really puts this across Skelton is very good in his first starring role--very funny fast handsome and intelligent Veidt is excellent as the evil Jones Rutherford and Grey are lots of fun as Skeltons girlfriends All three of them play off each other perfectly--their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small rolebr br Well worth your time
While many pass this off as a B movie it is indeed a first class comedy that is well-written and acted Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton better known to radio fans as The Fox Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wallys fiance Carol Lambert Conrad Veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals I read one account of this movie which states that Vincente Minelli directed this film not unless he changed his name to S Sylvan Simon who directed all three of the Fox movies This is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged So get over your black and white prejudice if you have one sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy This was also Reds first starring role Take note during the climax of the reference to Orson Welles War Of the Worlds broadcast
Is there any question that Jeffrey Combs is one of the true horror greats? This movie seriously doesnt suck and is sort of funny Watching a young Combs at work is great but I wish he had had more lines Look out for Beyond Re-Animator Its going to kick some azz
Look this movie is obscure brilliant and a classic that should sought out by any means necessary I suppose the powers that be have decided that it will forever be relegated towards the bargin bin; nevertheless we could only pray for the chance to see this one on DVD I would say that it even beats the great Phatasm If you like a dark movie with plenty of spooky imagery look for this one and see how an 80s horror movie is suppose to be
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack A bunch of drama school students steal Radzoffs corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it Radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave Writerdirector Norman Thaddeus Vane concocts a fresh original and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise offers a neat evocation of the glitzy Hollywood milieu and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere The kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods with a gal being set on fire a juicy decapitation (the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it!) and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights Kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar B-flick faces: Mayne has a deliciously eye-rolling ball with his flashy role Leon Askin contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed-up director Wolfgang Nita Talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium Mrs Rohmer plus there are nice turns by Luca Bercovici as jerky drama student ringleader Saint Jennifer Starrett as the sweet Meg Jeffrey Combs as the geeky Stu and Scott Thomson as the nerdy Bobo Popping up in cool bits are Chuck Porky Mitchell as a detective Patrick Wright in one of his customary policeman parts and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse Joel Kings polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look The moody score by Jerry Mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot A fun little fright flick
Ugh what an embarrassing episode last night! It was either a failed script for ABC Afterschool Special or the product of an earnest rookie writer just out of college making an homage to that classic PC anti-gun homily from 1974 The Gun In fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasnt of The Gun being melted down like in the movie!br br No Im not some NRA shill Its just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that I should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal Cause Id appreciate it if the lecture at least wasnt delivered via 2-by-4 Geez!br br OK the sociology lesson is over The Message has been delivered The Important Episode has been aired Now lets get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence
I have never missed an episode David Morse is a wonderful actor and I am hoping that this show can survive It certainly beats out that CSI crap I love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday I give the show a 10
AhhI didnt order no amazing hit showWell you got one Hack is simply the greatest television show ever made A little bit of me died when I flicked on the tv one Friday night to catch a little Hack and it wasnt on The show dug deep into key social issues of our culture I found that at the end of any episode I watched; I walked away having been both entertained and informed I am actually dumber now that Hack is gone I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate Since Hack has been gone I see them as eyesores and an unneeded strain on taxpayers So for the love of God we need to bring back Hack!
Hes not your conventional cab driverbr br This guys got issues With his wife with his son a priest all his fares his ex-partner and most of all himself And the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it So we have to keep watching to find out more about his pastbr br The idea may not be original but David Morse makes it so I think this is a great show and I hope people catch-on before the seasons over br br WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!
This is NOT your run-of-the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases The episodes so far are more realistic and intelligentbr br If you are looking for something with a lot of butt-kicking Rambo-style cop story you will not find it herebr br I gave it a 9 I wish this series lives long Morse is excellent!
Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetchedwell maybe a do-good cab driver in Philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met) but thats what makes the show greatbr br The fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun Its highly watchable and even though u know Mike wins out in the end he never wins in life David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role His supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great!br br All in all I watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action I watch this show because its got great acting a good premise and a great story-line every week Its also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by or know what intersection hes at I Love this show and I love Philly!! Give this show a shot!
It is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change! As an added bonus it is nice to see some local home boys from Massachusetts making good in LA I hope this show will be a keeper
An extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast One of the few shows that I try to watch on a regular basis Glad to see Bebe Neuwirth in a recurring role but feel Andre Braugher is underutilized He is one intense actor! Hope CBS gives it a better time slot next season
Okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again! Week in week out David Morses character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but whats wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven!!br br Due to the lack of love for this show by many I cant see it going to a season series - but you never know? The amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - lets hope something good can make it past a first series!!!
I like Hack Think the Lone Ranger reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver a decent but flawed guy in Philadelphia doing his best while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past and youve got the synopsis David Morse is nearly perfect as Olshansky He helps people but instead of riding Silver in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary Philly without handing out silver bullets The supporting cast is first class and well above average At times the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series The Rockford Files This show deserves a return hopefully in a better time slot than 9PM Friday(eastern)
I love this show Its clever and very well acted David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry The writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief After every new episode Im always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is My only complaint would be Donna Murphys absence at this point in the second season As David Morse ex-wife Heather she added such character to the showbr br I think this show is a credit to the crimedrama genre With that said - I can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating Would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique?
I am sick of series with young and clueless people talking about their problems all the time self centered boring and absolutely annoying (Popular; Dawsons Creek; Beverly Hills; etc) Hack is a breath of fresh air with a great actor (David Morse) a completely different plot credible people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very very good histories I just love it!! I hope Hack will go on for a long time because it is a great television series for grown up people for a change
David Morse and Andre Braugher are very talented actors which is why Im trying so hard to support this program Unfortunately an irrational plot and very poor writing is making it difficult for me Im hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them
I have only see three episodes of Hack starring David Morse and it looks as though Ive missed 37 episodes! well thats if ITV 3 are showing them in chronological order Ive just watched Misty Blue (episode 38) I have really enjoyed the 3 episodes but then Im a David Morse fan (esp St Elsewhere) For any one reading this Hack is excellent Pity its being aired on ITV 3 The cast is strong though I cant get used to the idea of David playing a bent cop still we all know hes the good guy wrongly accused I see Gary Cole has guest starred what ever happened to Midnight Caller? Just wonder if Hack is available on DVD (yet) Lovin it Cheers
Hey I didnt order no cab! Yeah well you got one What can I say about Hackwhat a man among men He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold If you were able to (and fortunately for Americas TV viewersone person per week was) penetrate the cold hard surface of Hacks exterior you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice The show was superb I laughed I cried I smiledall in the same episode My arms would break out in goosebumps when our dear friend Hack would exit his cab in another dark alleywith nothing more than his fistsready to avenge a wronged civilian A smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark alleys facial expressions when the Taxi of Justices headlights illuminated upon his face Week after week I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to bask in the warmth glow of Hacks brilliance I have never seen a better show and I mourned the loss of one of Americas greatest treasures when the show was canceled In other Hack-related news I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I are expecting Hack Koen to come into the world in about three weeks
It seems that Hack has been described as un-realistic but thats what TV is TV is meant to provide an escape from everyday life and I feel Hack does a great job in that regard Add to this the slow process of revealing his past and engaginginteresting plots; you just cant seem to get enough Plus with such great actors as David Morse Andre Braugher and even little Mathew Borish what more can you ask for So if you are looking for an involving experience and have a liking for underdog characters I suggest giving Hack a chance especially now that its finally getting off its feet
To keep it as simple as possible This is a very good show That is well written and has a fantastic cast Its not loaded with blood and guts And centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife his son his former partner (Andre Braugher) his childhood friend now a priest (George Dzunzda) and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode Are you likely to find something like this going on in your city NO Is this still a good story YES And its nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of his flaws Watch more then one ( 2-3) and youll see why a lot of us are hooked on this show And thank you David Morse for making this character so interesting Another good job!
I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary then later felt different about it I would return and make known my change of heart So far this is the first time its happened br br Im really starting to enjoy Hack Something has clearly changed The storylines seem to be much stronger The plot may still be a tad surreal but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven I attribute this to fine acting br br Not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner Some need time to pick up speed Im glad I kept watching this program and I really hope it lasts
I am not a fan of musicals but I am a huge fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even expecting greatness from the classic director This movie is BEAUTIFUL The shots are like oil paintings with motion something a lot of directors strive for but Renoir MASTERS I cannot express how much this movie transcends itself its not really a musical it just has a couple of well-placed musical numbers and a grand dancing finale But there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute JOY when watching itbr br I am a fan of foreign art films but Im also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies I get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in la la land but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible -- not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good 10 out of 10
As a longtime admirer of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge and a more recent admirer of Jean Renoirs film-making I knew that Id inevitably watch his French Cancan sooner or later The movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub The impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to turn Montmartre laundress Nini (Françoise Arnoul) into a cancan star without arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress the belly-dancing Lola (Maria Felix) This is just one of several love triangles in French Cancan--true to stereotype these French showbiz folk are always falling in lovebr br Renoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie Gabin perfectly incarnates the aging French playboy hero Arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously usedbr br French Cancan is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage etc only one character Casimir ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation The actor who plays him Philippe Clay is fun to watch--a really tall skinny young man who sings dances and does contortionsbr br The movie ends with a long cancan sequence as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together The dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in Moulin Rouge; in fact if I have one complaint about French Cancan its that the whole thing is a little too Technicolor Even when Nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song the lighting is bright and flat no shadows intruding Yes the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy; its just that I cant help thinking that things werent ever this colorful and innocent in real life
Like classic Hollywood musicals the plot is just an excuse A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancanbr br Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and setsbr br Consider it Jean Renoirs love letter to the Paris he grew up in Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who dont like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productionsbr br 
This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall In many ways this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s in that it has many clichés leading up to the inevitable conclusion (will the show STILL go on?) While of course none of this is new it was enjoyable and well made The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD In real life Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film But in FRENCH CANCAN the characters have fully functioning libidos--but nothing is really shown so the movie is okay for kidsbr br Nothing new but well done nevertheless
I just viewed Jean Renoirs wonderful film French Can Can It is a visual delight and a great entertainment The recently produced Moulin Rouge pales by comparison I didnt quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received Now Im convinced more than ever that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like Jean Renoirs version of the same story He succeeded in getting great performances out of his entire cast and the great French actor Jean Gabin was in rare form The dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting one Id ever seen It was long but I didnt want it to end This film deserves to receive more recognition than its got
Jean Renoirs homage to the Paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways Not only does it appear to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha it portrays the geographic Paris; the streets accessible only by staircases the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by Hollywood There is an obvious comparison to be made with Lloyd Bacons 42nd Street which had been made about 20 years before featuring Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation a fresh-faced kid from the sticks who had come to New York to get into show business who saves the show when the star fails--Youre going out there a kid from the chorus but youve got to come back a STAR!! Warner Baxters Julian Marsh is a director who suffers for his art and is unappreciated Jean Gabins Danglard keeps running afoul of genital politics but when he talks about the show he is more like Knute Rockne than like Julian Marsh Hes all about the game except--for his pointy thing He has a profitable new venture sewed up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as his next mistress His prospects rise and fall with every coital journey he takes br br Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro played by Maria Felix) slumming to a dive where he sees Nini (Françoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover Paulo the baker and discovers that she is a spirited dancer He uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage The prospect of money and fame charms Nini and she become Danglards next mistress as well as an apt student of the cancan which Danglard has dubbed French Cancan to cater to the current Anglophile tendency in the dancebr br Both 42nd St and French Cancan are tributes to show business--to modern entertainment--that has is own iconography and its own conceit 42nd St is centered around Julian Marsh a great director of Broadway shows which he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement The male juvenile is a middle-aged twit with lumbago replaced by Dick Powell the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide Danglard on the other hand goes from woman to woman seducing them with the promise of fame hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment One has no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active Postcoital scenes aboundbr br Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo he has discovered Esther a Piaf type and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the films theme song while he plays it on her fiddle That of course arouses Ninis jealousy just as she has aroused the jealousy of Lola (And of course Nini had already forsworn the privilege of being a Czarina!) The whole movie is about how Danglards concupiscence has cost him money but how even his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the show--how the audience demands devotion--and it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men At the movies conclusion Danglard having outfoxed the creditors and the jealous babes approaches a new attraction watching the incredible (and believe me it IS incredible) performance of the cancan Have you ever thought about being on the stage? he asks and the curtain descends Meanwhile poor Julian is sitting of the fire escape of the theatre listening to Peggy Sawyers new fans disparage his contribution to the shows success (I wont even go into 42nd Streets central line Oh Guy it was GRAND of you to COME!) br br Furthermore I wont go into the glimpse one gets of legendary Parisian entertainers including a brief vision of Piaf nor of the vision of a Paris both urban and rural Certainly there is a sample of the styles that engendered Trenet and Aznavour But it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity something unseen in any Hollywood musical with which it might be compared is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of 30s Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Astaire not to mention Dick Powell) let alone the barf promulgated by MGM in movies like the repulsive American in Paris All those fountains! Well save our comparison of that turkey to Breakfast at Tiffanys and its deconstruction of the American male for another daybr br That Danglard may have been a hopeful vision in postwar France of a kind of hyper-masculine mec that may or may not have ever existed is practically beside the point That he is a mans man neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton is perhaps more on target That he is a man who likes the ladies is never in question I for one wouldnt mind living his life at all I wonder if Gabin was that lucky br br At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called boloney I never got that far Bazs Moulin Rouge well Paris doesnt put that kind of stuff in the Seine anymore
There are frames in this film that could be Renoir paintings with vivid colors against muted backgrounds The humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence is refreshing in this fifties film and makes palatable the old story line of the ingenue that becomes a star The can-can number at the end seems realistic and exciting but not over the top as in an American dance sequence
Renoirs tale of Paristhe Cancana washer-girl and the Moulin RougeA more subduedbut highly entertaining version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge Jean Gabin gives his usual excellent performanceThe Technicolor photography on the print I saw was exquisiteAn easy evenings viewing chris w galla
Although it doesnt seem very promising for a long stretch Renoirs French Cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film The story is cliché: a laundry girl Nini (Françoise Arnoul) is discovered by a night club owner Danglard (Jean Gabin) Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers Nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too Im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have The film ends with the opening of Danglards new night club the Moulin Rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers The first of them Complainte de la Butte which also provides the base of most of the films musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and Renoir himself wrote it If youre a fan of Baz Luhrmanns 2001 film Moulin Rouge! youll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by Rufus Wainwright Although it isnt very prominent in that film everyone I know who owns the soundtrack loves it In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen Its hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl 810
French Cancan is one of my favorite all time movies Its an excellent film Theres color theres humor theres music Its a very good portrait of the so called Belle Époque though Jean Renoirs priorities were always to show a creation a fantasie So the film isnt a historical movie The final sequences in which the girls dance cancan are unforgettable images Its a film you shouldnt miss
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties Its the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway and the training of the dancers Finally the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are describedbr br Gabin is in great form as the easy-going Danglard--see him deal humorously with Ninis violent boyfriend Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini Maria Felix with that amazons body is imposing as the egotistical Lola Danglards first lover Finally Françoise Arnoul as Nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for Danglard and becoming his girl is just stunning; her loveliness and pert charm will win you overbr br A bonus: we get Edith Piaf Patachou André Claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the Moulin rouge
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical but in French way And a Jean Renoir nice tribute to his time his friends lovers music and dances It is at same time a show business chronicle of that age full of affection and French mood It is too a clear tribute to the Impressionism (people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture) It is particularly a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and of course to Jean Renoir father Pierre-Auguste You will find hear a trustworthy and splendid colored recreation of some Renoir master work Excellent casting scenery sound-effects and music Even it tell us about the creation of Parisian Moulin Rouge obviously it is a fiction story (and not very original by the way as it fall down in the very well know moral that the show must go on) But the Jean Renoir production is greatbr br 
Uncle Frank is everyones uncle This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America the lonliness the humor the irony Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were supremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience The director did an unbelieveable job of capturing the small and large pieces that made up their lives Thanks to everyone who helped in making this film!
This film works on a lot of different levels Its a profile of one very cool couple a social commentary on aging and nursing homes a love story a musical Ive seen Uncle Frank a few times and every time I watch it Im not sure who to go call first--my parents my wife a friend Ive lost touch with   But it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life--and want to reaffirm the ones that continue Expect a lot of laughs and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a chord Im pretty sure they will
It doesnt matter whether youve experienced the plight of the elderly in America or if youre just plain clueless Uncle Frank and Matthew Ginsburg give you that clue in a straight forward funny wake up and smell the roses sort of way By the end of the film it is obvious that while being totally entertained somehow youve also been educated A terrific film by a terrific up and coming talent in the movie field Matthew Ginsburg is a name to pay attention to
The silver screen gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying lifes rainbows Theres plenty of silver hair on this silver screen but the films namesake is more like 85-going on-25 with his energy humor and lust for life The story of entertainer extraordinaire Uncle Frank his devoted wife Aunt Tillie and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to live each day as if its your last and brings a glimmer of hope to those often-dreaded golden years A great movie for young and old audiences!
Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film The Journey starring Yul Brynner Deborah Kerr Robert Morley EG Marshall Anne Jackson and Jason Robardsbr br The film takes place during the 1956 Hungarian uprising and concerns a group of travelers having problems getting out of Budapest because of political problems in that part of the world They are put on a bus to Vienna but the Russians led by Major Surov (Brynner) confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards) posing as an American but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter whom the major believes is being smuggled out of Hungary In fact Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding him She becomes the focus of the Majors romantic attentionsbr br Very good film that conveys the tension and hassle of the Cold War and all of the performances are wonderful Brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate Major who isnt all bad and Anne Jackson gives a realistic powerful performance as a pregnant woman who doesnt want her child born in a Communist countrybr br Good script good director good cast - there should be more films like this Highly recommended
There have been many excellent comments about this movie and I want to add my voice to the praise Yul Brynner has never been more powerfully attractive His Major Surov was riveting Your eyes just cannot leave the screen when hes on it This is his movie This is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson As they were mostly stage actors they brought many nuances to their performances For example I have seen this movie at least 4 times but this is the first time I noticed the reaction of the German girl when she came face-to-face with a Russian soldier Even though he was not threatening her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in Germany after WWII and was most likely gang-raped by the Red Army The possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again Please put it on DVD
Most people will consider that Yul Brynners greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in from comic to tragic from eager to learn to dominating to hateful It also showed him to advantage as a talk singer and a dancer Finally as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as wellbr br But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I His comic turn in ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice So was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA or his Ramses in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS Yet he came terribly close to being a 1950s successor to Eric Von Stroheim as the man you love to hate A certain vulnerability in his acting and roles endeared him to the movie public even after his best years as a star were behind him - and he retreated more and more to repeating the King of Siam on television and the stagebr br To me his finest performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr Jason Robards Jr Robert Morley E G Marshall Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard The film is set in pretty modern times - the powder-keg that was Hungary in 1956 when briefly it looked like the Iron Curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad timing The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers) The West stood by and let this happen: England and France had gotten caught in the Suez crisis and the US had berated them and Israel for attacking Egypt Due to the actions of three close allies of the US the West found it hard to condemn the overkill of the Soviet Union It was an unfortunate situation and the Hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in itbr br In the film Brynner is Major Surov a Russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the Hungarian revolt one of whom is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards) Kedes may be getting assistance from some westerners on a bus tour through Hungary led by Robert Morley (including Marshall Jackson and Howard and Kerr) The latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired and Brynner mingles with them hoping for a lead to the whereabouts of Robards But Brynner is human - he tries to be ingratiating with these people (all of whom see him as a monster) and in sequence when he has drunk a little too much he confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945: How is it (even if one notes that Russia had Stalin in charge) that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? The allies on the whole had worked well together from 1941 to 1945 but after Yalta and Potsdam all types of mutual suspicions just erupted Did they have to? Surov is a good officer but he is torn in half by loyalty to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary that he supports and his growing fondness towards Kerr who is hiding Robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the Russian major And as the film reaches its tragic climax we watch as Surov has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty or take pity on Kerr Robards and the other westerners who want to leave It becomes a true struggle for him - and one that he may win far too late It was a great film about a tragedy of post war Europe and possibly the most thoughtful role Yul Brynner ever portrayed
Yul Brynner was a symbol of villein in the tine of 50s  he play a role of Russian leader in Hungary at the time of revolution in this country in 1956 that made it against the Marxismbr br The script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from Hungary to Englandbr br The best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the Hungarian Resistance to kill the Russian major(Yul Brynner) in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from his bad works  but at the end he made a good work to help Deborah Kerr for escaping her and her darling to London to write in his book a good working to gain at the end peoples agreement and trustment after his assassination by the Hungarian Resistance
The Journey is a very good film Produced in the spring of 1958 in Vienna and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in his early years Despite the political problems which influenced the movies success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution the Cold War) The Journey is a very good film but not well-known I think it should be released immediately on DVD because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner their intense relationship All their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore) Another quality is the script which is very well written It was even published as a novel by the screen player George Tabori The film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end At first we didnt know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary because the Communist Major discovers that Dianas friend Paul Kedes is Hungarian and he isnt allowed to leave the country The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is in fact the true reason why he doesnt want to let her go But after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses him too he lets her go And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed-the Major and Diana say Goodbye! she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers including Paul while Surov is shot several times by some Hungarians so he dies Yul Brynner is very very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful charming refined just like an English Lady Yul and Deborah are perfect together They are one of the greatest couples of the Golden Hollywood A true moviegoer should watch this film The Journey has everything that a good film should have-a great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is in my opinion at his best) Finally I want to give a message to Warner Bros Studios or those who restore and release classic films: Please release The Journey on DVD as soon as possible
As a big Dostoyevsky fan I had always been disappointed with Hollywoods halfhearted attempts to get into the Russian romantic aesthetic -- case in point Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov I had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind When given an intelligent script to work with he suddenly came alive and was as noble sexy and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri But thats because writer Tabori actually gave Yul as the Conflicted Russian Officer the kind of Conflicted Russian Officer lines that are worthy of real literature and that have real meaning and pathos in them For example a propos of folk music he says musingly You hear a man crying in the dark And if you listen carefully enough you know what he cries for You look surprised Lady Ashmore Despite what you may have heard tractors and Marxism arent the only things the Russian cares for There is always time for musicbr br Brilliant!!
a great movie with a rather unclear political message it´s shot in a theatrical style ic most of the action takes place inside mayor surov and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other emotions run high since the western tourists and business-people seem unwilling and unable to yield to the eastern-russian charm of the mayor although he makes every effort to understand their point of view the two opposite world-views are made pointedly clear but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics its powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie
I really enjoy this movie The first time it was on Turner Classic Movies All the actors did very well but Brynner steals the show again like always ( he is so sexy!)This is one of the movie that you do see Brynners emotions Actually this movie this is the first I ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong larger-than-life and serious roles in other movies In this movie you see both a masculine tough and sensitive side of Brynner Brynner seems to be a ladiesman in this movieThat is amazing how Brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian tongue it drives me crazy in love I dont understand when both Brynner and Kerr ( they both have very good chemistry) stars in a movie together and then Brynner always die at the end it kind of reminds you The King and I in a way
Yul Brynner is Major Surov a singing dancing vodka-drinking Russian Officer stationed near the Austrian -Hungarian border during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 in Anatole Litvaks The Journey Though the film has yet to be released on video or DVD it remains one of Brynners most compelling performances Because of the political unrest a group of travelers cannot fly out of Budapest but are put on a bus to Vienna Before they can reach the border however their passports are taken and they are detained for questioning by the Russians led by Major Surovbr br The Major has reason to suspect that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country Indeed Lady Ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger Paul Fleming (Jason Robards Jr) who pretends to be an American but fools no one She is helping Fleming mainly to repay a debt she owed because of the trouble her past association caused him Among the other passengers are a British journalist played by Robert Morley an American family played by EG Marshall his wife Anne Jackson and their two children one of which is the screen debut of little Ron Howardbr br Major Surov takes a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr) and a romance of sorts develops between them She offers him nothing but disdain and a stiff upper lip however though we suspect that underneath her heart still beats The Cold War intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing It remains however one of my favorite Yul Brynner films and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance
I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls smiles and laughs Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments Taras Bulba The Magnificent Seven The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shotbr br Equally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is Deborah Kerr The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive--she reprised this sort of role years later in The Night of Iguana The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the Russians in fact she is shown as running away from the Russian Major (in contrast to the Maupassant story or the Isak Denisen story) Yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the Kerr characterbr br Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress She puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character It is this contradiction that makes her roles in The journey Quo Vadis and The Night of Iguana memorablebr br Why is this an unusual film? It is not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people--Dr Zhivago was an exception Brynners Romance of a Horse Thief was again great cinema by Abraham Polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards Leftists in the post-McCarthy erabr br The film is also unusual in its casting--great French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee--rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr and British actor Robert Morley In many ways the film is international than American All four are great actors and add to the entertainmentbr br Those who have read Maupassant and Denisens works will find the film is not true to either work Yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized (censored?) version has a dignified charm of its own--provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group I think Litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales (eg the last bus ride and the final kiss)br br But I do have one grouse--why do Hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (eg Insomnia) have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria However three things complement the story making this an extremely good moviebr br First the actors use the actual languages of their roles The Russian soldiers speak only Russian; the Hungarians only Hungarian; the Germans only German except to the minimal extent to tell the story Since Debra Kerr is English she speaks only English and of course Yul Brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English As a result the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when heshe cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them Very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages the audience is never at a loss for following the film No subtitles are necessarybr br Second I was in Hungary in 1995 and Im telling you this movie has it right on From the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes the realism is incredible If I didnt eat in the actual restaurant in the movie I ate at its double I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village (Actually the film was shot in Austria)br br Third and most important this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified Of course Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship so the Acadamy wasnt going to give him another one but that is the quality of the film Dont miss this one
The Journey is a romantic version of the cold war Its about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards Jr) out of Hungary during the Hungary Revolt in 1956 Shes on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian borderbr br Of course the bus gets stopped by the Russians for a security check The Russian officer-in-charge (Yul Brynner) becomes attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr)and delays the trip Of course the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist posing as a British citizen but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the English woman to come to him Of course this all sounds absurd but it is a fun movie to watch Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr Brynner and Ms Kerr which seems inappropriate in the situation that they are in the movie becomes suspenseful and interesting The good acting overrides some of the silly dialogue Perhaps some people involved in the Hungarian Revolt would not appreciate this movie; they would consider it a piece of fluff br br This is my favorite Yul Brynner role He speaks with his own masculine voice and is very attractive especially when he becomes vulnerable This is Deborah Kerrs second time working with Yul Brynner since they made The King and I in 1956 They make a very attractive couple Too bad they never worked again This was the second sexy role Ms Kerr took since From Here to Eternity Despite the fact that Ms Kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the movie she was very beautiful and sensual br br The fine supporting cast was headed by Jason Robards Jr in his first film role Some of the international cast were recognizable like for instance Robert Morley from England However the rest of the actors I have never seen before or since were just great in the movie In the background it was fun to see Senta Berger as one of the maids speak a few lines of Hungarian A few years later in 1966 she was in a movie Cast a Giant Shadow with Yul Brynner as his leading lady She is still working today
Set in Hungary in November 1956 this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the Uprisingbr br Once the airport is closed the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria As would be obvious they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless Yul Brynner whose military power as a Red Army Major was marked with loneliness his internal struggle between right and wrong his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings He was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contactbr br Robert Morley plays the quintessential stiff upper-lipped Englishman who no matter how serious the role manages to maintain an almost light-hearted logical outlook on life while Jason Robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career Deborah Kerr as the leading lady exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her characterbr br The film deals with a very tempestuous time in European history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover Fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great one-liners and comedic instances that add to rather than detract from the movie The chemistry in the cat and mouse game between Kerr and Brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film togetherbr br All in all a thoroughly engrossing movie which I would definitely watch again 810
Very literate intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in the Hungary of 1956 by invading Russian Communist regime Kerr and Robards play lovers she a British baroness he a Hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his bit for his country Other New York theater stars of the period Anne Jackson & E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young sons including Ronny Howard in his screen debut Jacksons character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon-to-be communist country; she gives an impassioned plea in the third act of this film which presages the naturalistic acting styles weve come to know today from Redgrave Fonda & Streep Leading the pack of Soviet wolves is Yul Brynner magnificent as a commandant and at his sexiest since he played opposite Kerr in The King and I He is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely patrician & heroic Kerr This is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the Golden Era of American film Do not miss it
Good show really good acting and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting unpredictable way especially since essentially its two people in a room It doesnt race through like many modern films but doesnt drag either Bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the now of her character which is still involved and not going back on her career choices - so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep self-examination of her soulBrundage has the delicate balance of weight innocence meekness and class to pull off Buddy very well A bit grainy on the film quality but it fits the tone of the story Could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things but definitely worth watching
I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham AL which was actually a really fun festival and was blown away by it It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together Its an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality Story stems from real life occurrences ripped straight from the headlines Raw blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end The film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity Definitely not suitable for kids Too depressing for some peoples tastes Definitely worth checking out in my opinion though
Although it was dark depressing and at times hard to watch You Are Alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog It truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships In addition the soundtrack was amazing The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie br br Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever watched Her compelling and believable performance made the movie It made me wonder if she really IS a prostitute Who knows Anyway the movie was very worth seeing LOVE YOUR SISTER! yeah thats right
One of the BEST movies I have seen in a very long time Bechard has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappointbr br This movie has you guessing throughout and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen There are no bad guys or good guys Bechard makes sure of that The characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them you care about what they have been throughbr br Bechards use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of FAST FOOD MOVIES and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable - you love the feeling it gives youbr br I have heard it said too often that there are no NEW stories to tell Thank you Gorman Bechard for proving that falsebr br Run dont walk to see this movie
This really is a movie that you need to see twice When I first saw this film I was really drawn into the story While the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake wonderful allusion) and Daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world Through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels The soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly dark lo-fi and intriguing When you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending I have seen in a long time I hope to see this movie find a distributor for the DVD so that it will be more accessible Great movie you wont be disappointed
I had actually considered investing in this movie when Gorman was out drumming up funding I loved most of the script but did not like the ending Gorman insisted the ending was as it had to bebr br Seeing the completed movie I have to say I am amazed Reading the script I had not imagined the acting (and Gormans directing) would be as powerful and moving as it is here The two leads did an amazing job They were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing starsbr br Now for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please dont read further as you need to see the movie first (I actually wish I had never read the script just so I could have experienced the movie ending first hand) br br ----------------------------- SPOILER br br I have two main problems with the movie First off and Im sure I mentioned this when I read the script the wife should have died If she were dead the ending would be much more believable As it is we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him years ago If she left him and he is still in love after so long hed have to be seriously delusional But he doesnt come across that way in the script (There is also the problem of why he did not expend all this energy going after the wife he still loves)br br Plus if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe that they had a fulfilling reciprocating love and therefore believe that the guy is devastated enough for the ending to be reasonablebr br However I dont buy Daphne doing what she does in the ending Id need a heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore but believable due to Bohls performance) did what she did The character is simply not cold enough And if she did this out of some kind of love or something else then there is a whole piece of the moviestory missingbr br Much of this movie is reminiscent of Sex Lies and Video Tape I think it could have been as popular if Gorman had chosen to give the movie a more believable ending br br So watch the movie enjoy the performance And make up your own mind
I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere)br br A haunting intimate portrait of Loneliness and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darkerbr br The acting of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damagedbr br Reminded me in theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where Im Calling From)br br The Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itselfbr br Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise) and the best soundtrack Ive probably ever heardif that all make sensebr br The first 30 seconds pretty much tells you youre in for a twisted ride (I was surprised no one walked out right away during the Brooklyn premiere) But from there the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people Daphne and Buddybr br Theyre lonely mess-up and boy do they talk about sex Daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting some are quite funny (Mr Chang) some disturbing (the Harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be whats going on or what Daphne is really feeling) and because I have a friend who used to escort I might add most seem quite real br br You Are Alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant Okay maybe a couple minutes less of the talking and I dont know that wed have missed anything br br Then again I need to see it again knowing the endingbr br I like this moviebr br (The director asked people in the Brooklyn audience to write a review on IMDb because a lot of people read them Request granted)
This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness but it is a springboard for learning these people they re life styles and pasts which support thisbr br The two lead actors (Bohl Brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen %100 believable they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly into their world The actors seamless acting teamed with Bechards Beautiful realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finaleThis film is visual treat- soft increasing the intensity of The story The soundtrack serenades the viewer soothing yet drawing out the emotional content of the film I find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece intriguingintense
This was a fantastic movie about two people one a young teenage girl and the other a middle aged man who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved onesbr br Both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to The script although written by Gorman Bechard seems as though it was written from a womans point of view And at the same time men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the moviebr br The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless I would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one It is clear in this film that you are not alone
I am a film directors nightmare especially of the mega buck multiplex variety While not a student of the art I still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buying into the film makers vision if I can find it Thats why a gem such as You Are Alone is such an exhilarating find The intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful nuanced performances and director Gorman Bechard displays a deft hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged peoplebr br Spoiler belowbr br I bought the DVD version and have shared it with several people The reactions have been varied from disbelief in the ability of Daphne to complete the assignment for which Buddy has paid her to an inability to watch the whole film because it was just too real and emotionally devastating As a compulsively skeptical moviegoer I have to be either grabbed by the collars and hauled for the ride or sidled up to and seduced by the filmmaker This film took the later route for me and by the end I was so involved that I felt Daphnes horror and pain at her role in Buddys demise My reaction to this film reminded me of watching The Cook the Thief His Wife and Her Lover by Peter Greenaway many many years ago By the end I was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too Ive watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated I am familiar with other works he has been done including a couple of cheeky movies Galactic Gigolo and Attack of the Killer Bimbos and a mixed bag The Kiss which I recently learned was killed in the cradle by the producer and doesnt really represent the directors vision Too bad because I loved the prior two films and even found The Kiss interesting but wish The Kiss was available in a directors cut with all of the original vision and music in tact I look forward to future work by this interesting director and the leads Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage
You Are Alone is a beautiful almost delicate film smart directed crisply written with two complex and riveting performances and a twist of an ending that no one will see coming but will make you want to see the film a second time to go back and catch up on all the clues you misreadbr br The story about a highschool girl who drowns her depression and awkwardness by working a few hours a week as a $500 an hour schoolgirl escort and the depressed next-door neighbor who discovers her secret and hires her for an afternoon call in a downtown New Haven hotel features breathtaking performances from both Jessica Bohl as the girl and Richard Brundage as her neighborbr br Bohl as Daphne gives a breakthrough performance on par with Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary She so captures a teenagers angst of growing into her own skin and when she talks about always being in control you start to realize shes not in control at all but in danger of going over the deep end which I guess in a way she doesbr br Brundage as Buddy is depressed angry heartbroken a shell of a man But it isnt until the films startling conclusion that you grasp a full comprehension of his painbr br After a very brief opening segment which will hook most independent film lovers and have the religious right running towards the exits we are brought into the hotel room At first youre not sure about these people or the film-making style Shaky annoyinglike the characters Until you realize their back story told in short flashbacks Theyre confrontational at first for a reason and so is the camera But as they open up as the story settles down likewise so does the camera And I dont know 20 minutes in give or take you find yourself unable to take your eyes away from the screenbr br Having just seen the world premiere screening at the Brooklyn Film Fest -- where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the ending and not one person answered yes  I almost wish the film were already on video so I could watch it again Because thinking back now on some of the conversations in the film particularly a very candid dialog regarding fantasy and climax I really thought things were going in a very different direction But I realize now so much of their conversation meant something completely different than what I imagined I need to see it again!!! But as dark and sexual as much of the talk is blunt to say the least I found myself laughing more than I might have expected at some of its candor which definitely falls into the things we think but lack the nerve to say out loud category Its very blunt especially when you realize so much of it has a completely different meaning Some of it will make you uncomfortable especially if youre watching You Are Alone with a partner Youll definitely have something to talk about  perhaps argue about  afterwards Perhaps it should come with a warning: You SHOULD be alone when watching! The music is amazing I would have come home and purchased the soundtrack at my favorite online music store if I could have The film looks as good as anything shot on film After the screening director Gorman Bechard was asked what sort of process he used to get the digital footage to look so good His answer: none They couldnt afford itbr br I have to give Bechard credit I am a big fan of his two shorts The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror but even they could not have prepared me for the complexities and surprises of this filmbr br To everyone involved: bravo
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured andor as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between theyre pain Death is explored figuratively and literally It is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive too awake to reality It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-bys This film explores the aching pain in us all the frown beneath the cheery facade the ache below The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and matter of fact and then Bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all Bechard the writer is a expert observer of the human condition and because of his non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield our eyes from but yearn to see and understand He as director focuses on the nuances of the actors spirit that shines through the character theyre playing to the actors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation This is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and womans experience together I have encountered as of yet even though the two characters encounter is probably not the normal encounterbr br The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough It is each characters real voice sung through the beauty pain talent and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide itbr br I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr Bechards both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it
I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you You Are Alone is that movie (for me) The film is constantly in my head and in my heart I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again as if I am seeing it for the first timebr br There is nothing I did not like about the movie Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect Very emotionally stirring!!! It was compelling and rivetingbr br I adored Jessica Bohl and her performance was the greatest I have ever witnessed I admired Brittanys strength (what a strong woman)br br The tag line is When your darkest moments come to life We never know what we are capable of doing Everyone says oh I would never do that when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation We are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject The honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite partbr br Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art!!!!
The 1980s My Dinner with Andre with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit 2005s You Are Alone demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul br br The story revolves around three principal characters Theres Daphne a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life Then theres the prostitute or paid escort Britney as self-confident as Daphne is self-conscious What makes them interesting is that they share the same body if not the same personae Part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the early scenes where Daphne approaches a door of an aged hotel room She halts and is obviously torn by the decision of whether or not to knock on the door  but it is Britney that effortlessly glides into the room when the door is openedbr br On the other side of that door is Buddy a middle-aged nobody with few if any personal qualities that anyone would find attractive He goes so far as to be confrontational about Britneys chosen profession as soon as she enters the room However we soon learn that Buddy is Daphnes next-door neighbor and has watched through the years as she grew from little girl to womanhood This complicates things for the audience Is Buddy just being a concerned neighbor or does he want something else?br br If its sex that Buddy wants here it is Britney loves sex Her definitions may be Clintonesque but that doesnt lesson her enthusiasm She prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic wristbands that her clients are invited to chose from Each color band denotes a specific act that shell perform  but exactly which act isnt revealed until after the band is broken off her wrist and the choice is irrevocably made br br Britney is or believes that she is in control of every encounter Even when blindfolded and bound as she is by one of her regular clients she imagines her arms and body being stroked by multiple men but her legs and pubic area being caressed by a woman in blood red lingerie The films imagery just keeps comingbr br Buddys pathetic life is one of acceptance Hes lost his wife his dog even his fantasies of the pretty teenager next-door Its no coincidence that hes lured Daphne or Britney to this particular hotel room Theres a painting on the wall of a dinner plate with only a fish head left This is a perfect metaphor for Buddys life; all of the good parts are finished So its here where he brought his wife when they were still college students that he makes his stand  to regain some control of his own life to make his statementbr br The director of You Are Alone Gorman Bechard knows his craft The principal action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film assisted by a myriad of inter-cut scenes that add dimension to the characters their circumstances and conflictsbr br As the film progresses Britney asks Buddy if she should get undressed He says yes but she strips only to her underwear An actual prostitute would probably remove all of her clothes (one of the professions five gets) But it isnt Buddy thats being teased we are As the film concludes we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in play A tease doesnt work unless it actually delivers Britney does so does You Are Alone
The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there The screenplay is intense and does not wander The plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsdens Center for Cultural Arts After the film ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still bothered While we put an 18 and up age restriction on the film I would watch the film with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation
I caught this at the Chicago IndieFest and have to say YOU ARE ALONE is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think Not HA HA Wedding Crashers funny but sick twisted I cant believe she just said that but its so damn true funnybr br Jessica Bohl who deservedly won Best Actress is amazing to watch Theres never a moment when you think oh Im watching a movie and shes an actress Shes too damn real for wordsbr br In fact theres 2 scenes that Im still giggling over and I wont give them away but in one shes in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how awesome it is (I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing!!!) br br In another she talks about a teenagers definition of sex versus an adults and if it isnt the truest dialog Ive heard in a movie in a long time I dont know what is
Jessica Bohl plays Daphne the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school Daphnes neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage) a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan yet details of each characters history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks Their appointment climaxes with the storys concluding twistbr br Both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance Their on-screen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuinebr br The films dialogue is natural real to life The writer Gorman Bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate Daphne is intelligent yet clearly still an eighteen year old Buddy may be middle-aged but still not the hackneyed naïve type normally depicted in film Daphne and Buddys conversation primarily deals with their despair and frustration with life but is still comical at the right times Although the general mood is very relaxed the dialogue has its own vivacity forcing the audience to become empathetic toward the characters conditions and uncomfortable at their straightforward vulgaritiesbr br The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film Each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters Even existing independently from the film the compilation truly expresses You Are Alones central theme-- lonelinessbr br You Are Alone is a less conventional piece that deals with of notions typically not spoken Definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness
If youre tired by the same repetitive unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases youll enjoy You Are Alone It is thought provoking well shot and rivetingbr br Without revealing anything that you dont find out in the first few minutes of the movie this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor The vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to comebr br Through their discussion you explore two shifting views of prostitution depression loneliness Yet the movie is not depressing It talks about dark things without being depressingbr br As a viewer your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around but gently You come out of it with a lot to think about I like that in a movie
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado played to perfection with expert timing and panache dont watch this version If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle strutting around in 1930s english gentlemens private club society this is the one to watch Its a lot of fun and a good intro to Gilbert and Sullivan but after this rush out and rent the Canadian Stratford version Youll see the difference between good and great Nobody does G&S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group
There are times I am convinced that The Mikado is the best Sullivan & Gilbert opera ever but that is only so long as Im not listening to Iolanthe Be that as it may The Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the Savoy Operas (Yes I put the composer first Nobody says Hammerstein and Rodgers or Hart and Rodgers or Boito and Verdi or Whats-His-Face and Strauss You dont even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach Suppe or Balfe Gilbert was just the bigger name (and the bigger ego) at the time so they put his name first Its time that silly practice was put to restbr br Anyway The Mikado is a compleat S&G operetta It has some of Sullivans catchiest numbers combined with some of Gilberts cleverest lyrics It has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue Its got a wonderful degree of craziness And it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costumingbr br This particular production filmed in a live performance in 1990 turns its imagination toward striking simplicity Set in a British seaside resort toward the end of the Art Nouveau period it throws over the japonerie of the original entirely The result is costuming and setting in an eye-caressing medley of whites grey and blacks accented by occasional bits of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green) It takes some getting used to but its really spiffy Of course when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of Japan you would be right to exclaim Oh pooh Bah! (Did I just say that?) Its most gratifying that this fine production is now on DVD However one caveat: the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy The tendency to superimpose images is alas annoying Why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy-fartsy stuff of that sort? But its the performance that counts the most We may skip the overture since although one is performed Sullivan never wrote one (True it may be so he wrote none for any of the Savoys But the Mikado overture doesnt even date from Sullivans lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others) As for the rest of the operetta its first-rate and supremely funnybr br The Ko-Ko here is the estimable Eric Idle who does it credit There is a tradition of bringing a Big Name into the role The was a US TV production years ago in which Ko-Ko was played by Groucho Marx with mixed results Idles performance is delightfully quirky  he does Taken from a county jail assisted by a tennis racquet His Ive Got a Little List is done as a speech to a microphone -- of course it has the usual updated lyrics which are much funnier than the usual run of such things and his delivery is positively hysterical It goes on that way throughoutbr br In this operetta its important to have a good Katisha; its just no fun if youre not being bellowed at in style This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer in her way almost as Big a Name as Idle She bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto  wonderful especially for a soprano And her costume!!! (Not to mention her recital with Franz Liszt apparently accompanying) Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone I have trouble getting around is somewhat un-Nanki-Pooish chubby shortness -- but is voice is undeniably a solid rich addition to the vocal palette There is a nice touch during A Wandring Minstrel where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of his nancy on his knee -- bear in mind the Mikados decree about flirting Be that as it may Bottone is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesnt put the best face on Nanki-Poo his performance doesbr br Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly She and Bottone do lovely duets Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his persona as something a blageur and does it very well Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water  a role later done to death in American sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children -- that sort of thing) The Mikado (Richard Angas) is bloody marvelous with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyricsbr br I dont recommend you get this as your only Mikado Get a good traditional production as well so you can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging That being said Ill watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once On the whole this is a terrific offering a vocal and visual delight with delicious over-acting Its a DVD to treasure with dervish-like maids tap-dancing bellhops and all Watch for the bellhops with signs
I first saw this on Thames television and loved it I subsequently saw a dreadful write-up by someone who certainly hadnt watched or listened to it So I bought a copy and then I bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD The Australian version is great but this one is better! I might buy another
I really enjoy this particular production of The Mikado The producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences -- for instance As Some Day It May Happen (the little list song) is completely updated and a few lines are ad-libbed throughout the play Liberties were also taken with the setting The costumes are not Japanese but rather 1920s English (although some of the Tittipudlian girls wear 20s-inspired kimonos) This production is well-choreographed with some 1920s dance styles and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes (as well as ears) entertained during the songs If youre a Gilbert & Sullivan purist these changes may bother you but I think theyre fine -- and I love the costumes! br br Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely hilarious; all of her scenes make me laugh out loud (one of my favorite add-ons is when she first makes an entrance -- the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics so she screeches at the top of her voice STOP IT!!!) All of the other main characters do a fine job as well I particularly like Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush (that toupee!) and Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yumbr br You must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly There is no change of setting although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest If there is one draw-back to this production it is that the stage makeup wasnt modified for close-up shots with a camera Foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner lipstick and blush everywhere Ive seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays and its a little jarring at first However I hope youll get used to it and enjoy The Mikado for what its worth -- a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic!
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film The writing acting directing could not have been better This was a story that begged to be told and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so Stories like this one are not pleasant ones but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed A film that can do that is a rare a special thing Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film br br Thank you for telling this story!!!br br Ruby
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings Such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it And Eric is hotter than ever To often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people Hey we are just like everyone else And this movie showed just that We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice It is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that I cant wait till this comes out on DVD Thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday There are good and bad in EVERY race why make them all out to be bad? That goes for all races today John Harper was an educated man he graduated from high school he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation He was a kind and gentle soul he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right I wasnt very old when he left our house but I can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother couldnt be bothered He even taught grade 3 the year before he came to Winnipeg None of this is mentioned in the movie and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as Im concerned What happened to John is unforgivable not only in the native community but also in the white community Not everyone in Winnipeg think like the police do I knew the person inside and what he was like as a PERSON not an Indian!
The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief(the Indian) by an Winnipeg city officer(the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie The actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada a small scale Martin Luther King thing The misjustice of First Nations people is becoming a staple in the Canadian cinema diet What makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the familys reactions The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach(WINDTALKERS SKINWALKERS)have minor almost cameo appearances Soon-to-be star Eric Schweig makes his mark in this film with a powerful performance An honourable mention goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk who has chalked up over 100 movies to his credit His portrayal of the troubled soul Inspector Dowson was worthy of a Gemini Award(the Canadian Emmy)along with Eric Schweig The special effects(jump cuts dream sequences) are occasional and not overbearing Couple this with some beautiful northern Canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and First Nations people like the Neil Stonechild case and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience
Blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action I cant wait for Blade 2 This is one of Wesley Snipes greatest movies the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great
Okay sure this movie is a bit on the hokey side Its difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher anyone?) but this tries very hard Ive never read the actual comic book but that doesnt really matter I suppose I judge a film mainly on its merits not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone elses idea (Unless its a film based on a true story that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy) So why will I give this movie a fairly high rating? Because it tries It tries very hard In my book that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining filmbr br Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus It seems everybody has their take on vampire lore be it the cross the silver the garlic the aversion to sunlight whatever Some of those ideas are included here The storyline is familiar a group of vampires conspire to take over the world with one person (mainly) standing in their way Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses who have slowly but surely moved into the world and share it with humankind For the most part the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them The vampires have even taken familiars people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turnedbr br Now that I think of it there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film They Live A hidden enemy hidden group of people plotting against them the fight to save human-kind all that is present in Blade as wellbr br The acting isnt the best here Snipes is at best only slightly better than some of his other roles; NBushe Wright a relative newcomer isnt too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blades sidekick (hes to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher) Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here as the head vampire you just love to hatebr br I dont know but I just loved the special effects in this film From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film the special effects arent half bad Theres certainly enough blood and gore to go around but after all this is a vampire movie right? The various shapes and sorts of weaponry Blade uses are fairly unique and not generally used in contemporary action films Snipes has more flair with a decked-out sword than he does with say a machine gun Plus theres so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away (Unless of course you are Indiana Jones)br br Overall this isnt the best action film ever made but its not half bad either As a bonus the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool too Tell me in what other movies can you hear super drumnbass like Source Direct or Photek?!br br My Rating: 810
hibr br Blade is an sensational action movie  the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain have done justice to their rolesbr br The movies action sequences are better then Matrix! br br Wesley Snipes is one the best action heroes everbr br If u like actionvampire movies  this is the ONEbr br the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made beforeBut these is the best of thembr br Enjoy the Ride
Its got action and fantasy mixed all together what more do you want in an action movie? And it also has one of the best martial artists in the movie industry today Wesley snipesSo all in all this movie hasnt left anything out And thats my comment of what I think is a classic beat em up movie
Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics present a plot and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel And thats exactly what this movie happens to deliverbr br However unlike with most other comic book movies I felt that this one did it with a bit of class Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes Blade presents a very modern believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (ie sappy) aspect is concernedbr br Yes the movie has innumerable plotholes and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this what else matters? It may run a little long but for what it sets out to do Blade stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre
In this film I prefer Deacon Frost Hes so sexy! I love his glacial eyes! I like Stephen Dorff and the vampires so I went to see it I hope to see a gothic film with him Blade it was very about the future If vampires had been real I would be turned by Frost!
Blade is probably one of the best vampireaction movies ever madeIt has it all:actionhorrorbloodthis movie is for action fansIts either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it it means you dont like action or vampires moviesWesley snipes takes his role seriously and he his the perfect guy for blade
Great underrated movie great action good actors and a wonderful story line Wesley is verry good and the villain the bad guy is wonderful The girl plays a nice role and the comedy mixed with blakness!
I loved it In fact I watched it over and over and over and I could watch it again This movie doesnt get boringbr br The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie Its a job well done great for todays generationbr br Wesley Snipes was born for this role Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire Arly Jover mmmm mmm she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has Donal Logue provides great comical reliefbr br This vampire movie is like no other I cant wait for Blade 2
this film was brilliant! i absolutely loved it! wesley snipes was great for this role - and im sure blade 2 would be just as goodbr br blade is by far one of my favorite actionhorror movies out there! and if you havent seen it yet and like vampires and blood (all that stuff) you should really rent it because i assure you that youll love it!
I remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that I vowed to buy the video when it came out br br While I wont go too far into dissecting this film I will say that I gave it an 810 for all the reasons you can read in the other users reviewsbr br What I will say is this: br br The first 10 minutes of this film are incredible Its as close to a textbook audience grabber as Ive ever seen I once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutesbr br Everyone who watched the opening stayed to the end
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever I liked this one even more than X-men In fact this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade He is just not an emotionless super hero Also this movie isnt sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating Sure comic books are for kids mainly but I like a little more in my movies Lets face it if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic This comic book adaptation also has something that many dont A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy Lets face it none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight
This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud The movie is a fast paced thrill ride of action and superb stunts The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too Wesley should have done more action films than he has i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all only Bruce Willis Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close Also aswell as Wesley being quality Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing but he does Overall the film is sharp stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace
Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn - fast loud and moody Despite my initial fears Kris K carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence Lots of blood steel silver burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction IF you like the black look of The Matrix then Blade will appeal to you Blade even has a dodge the bullets sequence
For a brief moment The opening scene with Traci Lords and thebr br techno bar is incredible Id probably follow her to my ultimate death too! Best vampire movie of all time but with a twist The fight scenes are awesome Wesley Snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary Great flick 910 Wheres Blade II?
However closely the movie is to the comics it doesnt matter This movie radically moves away from the boredom of Interview with the Vampire (although its acting was good) and slides in the wonderful action scenes Very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all Disadvantage - poor graphics Does it matter? Nope
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations Blade is by far one of the best realised and most faithful (overall) to the source material given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvels Tomb of Dracula the writer took almost ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comics history While changes were inevitably made the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms Dont let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one fine film If it feels too comic booky for you Stanley Kubrick snobs out there its because its supposed to Deal with it but dont dis it for it
Blade is a dark gloomy but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones A bit of gore but nothing really that bad Wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires Not really like buffy because thats too tame but Blade delivers a decent plot and its the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy nightthats at best viewing!br br 87%
Overall I give this film a decent 76 To start Ill say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras youll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film Among the changes Blade is now most importantly half vampire therefore acquiring all of their strengths but none of their weaknesses The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really Wesley Snipes is born to play this role although some wouldve probably pererred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol) His acting here doesnt need to be exactly Oscar winning per say considering the character but Im glad he decids to play the DayWalker in the two sequels Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blades Alfred so to speak The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts Ive got to say As much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like Spider-Man or X-Men Stephen Norrington had the villains portrayed in a way I didnt like so much honestly Their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didnt really feel like a comic book film to me Plus La Magra a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it I guess Not to mention a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beaing the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kindawelldumb Moving away from a few of its flaws the music by Mark Isham was great and fitted the film nicely Luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel Blade 2
Blade would be an extremely above-average comic-book vampire-hunter actionhorror if it werent for two minor flaws #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible BladeSnipes do his slicing and dicing but the whole Yes! fistpunch was literally a letdown #2 Bad no make that horrible CGI  even for 1998 standards This is mainly in the last third but some sprinkled throughout Okay despite those minor infractions I really enjoyed this movie All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another Matrix rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior So maybe The Matrix copied Blade At any rate its a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks action fanatics and horrorvampire lovers So we have Blade half-manhalf-vampire or day-walker and his accomplish Whisler (a la Batman and Alfred) battling the undead who apparently almost out number humans Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blades more of an antihero) our sword ninjavamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialistdoctor Meanwhile trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it Its not the most original concept if you read what I just wrote but still highly enjoyable You will want to see Blade succeed you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms And you will know whats coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie Still watch this without trying to go too deep Such as Vampire SPF-1000 suntan lotion? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldnt that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh okay I am going too deep Once again sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride
Hope the summary line wont irritate you that much (its a little homage to the Chappelle ShowCharlie Murphy but also to the character Daywalker) But Ill try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didnt like in another paragraph so it will be easier to read! br br Lets start with the good things! The quote strong bloody violence (which is used by rating boards to describe the content of a movie does fit here very well This is not a movie for kids! Or for the faint of hearted! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to holdjustify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent The action scenes are great here toobr br OK over to the things I didnt like The overall story is too thin Its enough as Ive written above to hold the action scenes together but there could be more And a character like Blade deserves more (imo) The drama therefor isnt the best  also its use of clichés doesnt help Some characters are underwritten  Thats that! :o)
I admit I go more for the traditional vampire tale but this one is a real winner Lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours There was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world A good one for all us vampire lovers
It seems to me that a lot of people dont know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men Daredevil Punisher and the likes What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe At least until he was reinventedbr br David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight He cant take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character He is however a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels) Kris Kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing NBushe Wright however is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character German Udo Kier should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race probably born of his experiences from playing Dracula Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I have perhaps ever seenbr br The story is good and I feel renews the vampire genre (something that hasnt been done since Robert Rodrigues From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic Far from it A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible Including the effects which are pretty good for their time I found the vampire dustings to be a very nice touch In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great The fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its facebr br As previously stated Norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following Blade movies Del Toro is nearly as skilled but I prefer Norringtons style His style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere A very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story Along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the moviebr br All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie suffice to say many of them are located near the ending of the film) does that the film must settle with a high 7br br 710
Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade a half human half vampire known the daywalker He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the worldbr br This movie is well cast written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish Packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue Blade is certainly more action than horror but it definitely deliversbr br 810
If you like horror or action watch this film ASAP If the opening scene doesnt get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse Great Action excellent casting and top one-liners This is the only film I have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop kick & punch thrown Not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun Its a pure rush of dark comic book action 910
Blade is a fantastic actionthriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yetbr br This film has everything that you would ask for in an actionthriller it has plenty of blood guts and gore a twisted disturbed bad buy moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twistsbr br Their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects Wesley Snipes fighting movement is fantasticbr br This film is in my opinion a must see Wesley Snipes cool solid appearance makes this film and I cant wait for the sequel BLADE 2 being released next yearbr br My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10
Now here is a movie that does something that hasnt been done in a long time It take ten or so different elements that were already familiar with (Vampires martial arts a techno beat top-o-the-line special effects etc) and turns it into something that feels brand new In what could have easily been merely a combination of Mortal Kombat and Buffy: The Vampire Slayer Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of Passenger 57) gives a really good turn as the half human half bloodsucker He acknowledges the internal conflict but doesnt dwell on it more than necessary He makes Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton made Batmanbr br Ill say that the only part of the movie that got me a little miffed was the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happens to know who happens to know exactly how to stop the evil guy On the other hand you sort of have to have that in a movie like this so its easily excusablebr br Well Snipes is good And Steven Dorff hyped in the previews makes a more than bad enough bad guy to Snipes hero Hes got class presence and enough control in his little pinky to teach Al Pacino how to tone it down a bit Who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launching pad for an actor? I sincerely hope this is And whoa! where the heck did Kris Kristofferson get acting talent? Dont get me wrong but the prolific actor hasnt done anything memorable since Millennium and how many of us watched that just cause of the cool video box? Well here he is folks in a very Obi-wanish turn as Blades mentor and father figure And good job toobr br The quality of the acting is matched by the quality of the choreography and special effects Accompanied by a pulsing techno beat the fight scenes brings back and quickly banish memories of Mortal Kombat Hey! It had a script too! I was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out therebr br The two major indications to me that I saw a quality flick were these; I had no feeling of remorse about paying full price to get in a la any Schumacher Batman The Avengers MK: Annihilation Godzilla or Armageddon (wow how many of those came out this year? Ugh) Also I look forward to the inevitable sequel as per the films ending Lets just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first onebr br 
I didnt see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks Ever since the Batman series Spawn Judge Dredd and many other pitiful pg-13 bombs I dodged everything at all cost I would question in my mind why cant someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story how difficult is that? And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence blood martial arts weapons fire the good against evil etc Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies and most of them have bombed But not Blade the movie was filmed just right not going overboard delivering a good length and never a dull moment Blade II is cool but not as cool as the first Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks Ive seen in a long time
I must confess that Ive been a huge fan of the almighty David the Hoff Hasselhoff ever since he starred in the hit 80s TV series Knight Rider Whether its his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy Revenge of the Cheerleaders or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the schlocky sci-fi gem Starcrash the Hoff has proved time and time again that hes a simply terrific (and shamefully underrated) actor supreme The Hoff excels here as Gary a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with his repressed virginal writer girlfriend Leslie (attractive brunette Leslie Cummings) investigates a seedy dilapidated haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of Massachussetts Theyre doing research on witchcraft throughout the ages and the hotels last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts A bickering family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel Pretty soon various folks begin to get bumped off in assorted gruesome ways by the mysterious Lady in Black (an effectively eerie Hildegard Knef)br br Granted the rest of the cast gives the Hoff a run for his money: the ever-perky Linda Blair projects her customary charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who winds up becoming possessed (natch!) legendary jazz singer Annie Ross bitches it up with gleeful aplomb as a snippy old bat (poor Annie winds up being incinerated alive after she has her lips sewn shut and shes hung upside down in a chimney) and gorgeous blonde Catherine Hickland oozes considerable sex appeal from every fetching pore as a lusty slut Fabrizio Laurentis competent direction a suitably creepy atmosphere Gianlorenzo Battaglias slick glossy cinematography (the fluid prowling Steadicam tracking shots are especially nice) the gaudy special effects Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Millers spirited shudderynspooky score and the gory sadistic violence are all up to par But ultimately its the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the Hoff which makes this choice tasty chunk of tacky Italian horror cheese such a winner: He takes his shirt off once (hubba hubba!) gets sprayed with blood and -- WARNING: Major SPOILER ahead -- even meets a pleasingly grisly untimely end Produced by none other than Joe DAmato this picture overall rates as good sleazy fun

Witchery is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly hes one of the better actors Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoffs wifeshe is hilariously bad! The plot of this film is ridiculous too Its got some holes which you cant help but notice but it remains entertaining throughoutbr br The gore in Witchery is freaking outstanding I loved the part where the old bag gets sucked into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast! And the part where the lady gets taken advantage of by the Devil was pretty damned disturbing Id say this one is a must for gorehoundsbr br If youre looking for an overproduced well-acted flick look elsewhere But if you like old-school style Italian sleaze and over the top gore Witchery belongs on your shelfbr br Im surprised by the low rating on here! What were you people expecting The Exorcist? 7 out of 10 kids
Linda Blair has been acting for forty years now and while she will never escape the part of Regan MacNeil in The Exorcist few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as Witchery does She plays Jane Brooks a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch (Hildegard Knef) It seems that a long-ago witch-hunt resulted in her suicide and she was with child at the time Unaware of the danger Jane has recently dreamt of the witchs dramatic death and Janes little brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) has been more directly visited by her spooky black-clad spirit which he calls the lady in black The groups time at the island inn begins quietly enough; unknown to them however the Lady in Black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat (George Stevens) Before long the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the Lady in Black begins her reign of terror She plans to avenge her own fate by possessing Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child Each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse - greed lust and the blood of a virgin As the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild she haunts them one by one in gruesome horrifying ways The island location is effectively scary and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot Its such a colorful film that it reminds me of Dario Argentos work The lighting is excellent and the set decoration is perfectly spooky The soundtrack is very effective and unique The horror effects are extreme terrifying and unforgettable The cinematography is great and it is this that brings us back to Linda Blair The creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot: lots of dramatic push-ins lingering close-ups that subtly detail Janes incremental possession and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films There are hidden homages to Rosemarys Baby Jacobs Ladder The Shining Black Sunday and of course The Exorcist She does a great job and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance That isnt to say that the rest of the cast disappoints; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good and veteran performer Annie Ross is memorable as Janes bitchy mother Rose Hasselhoff gives it his best but he is not essentially a film star and his television persona gets in the way of his performance Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together The film is otherwise so violent and creepy (in a good way) that it desperately needs their warmth (Blair also played a mother in 2003s Monster Makers and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them) Lastly Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch and she has the most amazing voice and accent Along with Blair she was also perfectly cast But its Blairs movie all the way Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability and this aspect of the film hearkens back to Exorcist II: The Heretic I think Witchery is up there with The Exorcist Exorcist II Hell Night and Summer of Fear as Blairs best genre work to date
Witchery or Witchcraft as its commonly known in Europe beings with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) waking up from a nightmare involving a witch Janes Mother & Father Rose (Annie Ross) & Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from Boston renovating it & reopening it Together with Jane & their young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) Rose & Freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to check on the amount of work that needs doing they also meet up with the estate agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) & hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island Once there they enter the hotel & begin to inspect the property while back on the boat Sam is killed & the boat is let loose to sail off into the distance They discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) & his virgin fiancé Leslie (Leslie Cumming) who happens to be researching a book that she is writing about the gruesome legends & superstitions surrounding the infamous island & hotel As the night draws on a raging storm outside isolates them from the mainland as a mysterious lady in black (Hildegard Knef) keeps popping up as the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks fresh victims for demonic possession human sacrifice & Satanic ritesbr br The director of this American Italian co-produced film is somewhat shrouded in mystery as the IMDb lists Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin but there are rumours that Joe DAmato did the honours either way to be honest despite its bad reputation I found Witchery quite entertaining in a so-bad-its-good cheesy sort of way The script credited to Harry Spalding & Daniele Stroppa on the IMDb again is confusing too as the actual credit on the film itself is Daniel Davis anyway whoever wrote this thing did a decent job please stop laughing At heart its a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths & a surreal feeling to everything The different sets of characters have reasonable motives & didnt get on my nerves as much as Id thought they might its not plotted very well it doesnt make a whole a lot of sense & the dialogue isnt exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole Witchery entertained me for its 95 odd minute duration plain & simple Its reasonably well paced a little slow to get going maybe but there are plenty of surreal bizarre goings-on & gruesome deaths to keep one amused One part of Witchery which destroys some of its credibility is this so-called storm there is no storm in sight & the sea is probably calm enough to swim in Witcherys supposed twist ending didnt really work for me either & just check out the dumb expression on Cummings face on that final freeze-frame The hotel provides for a good isolated location & adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive indefinable horror feel throughout cheap horror at that Technically Witchery is not too bad at all it was obviously shot on location so it looks good throughout & while not exactly the pinnacle of film-making finesse its overall production values are slightly better than expected The violence & gore is of typical Euro explicitness a woman has her lips sewn shut & hung inside a fireplace so she cant scream as the others light it someone is crucified & then burned alive impaled on a swordfish someones veins expand & pop & a woman is raped by a man with no lips Witchery was shot in English so there is no dubbing as far as acting goes David Hasselhoff & Linda Blair in the same film what more can I say?! Yes ladies Hasselhoff does take his shirt off & for the lads Cummings takes hers off Both Hasselhoff & Blair are a hoot to watch in this thing however the little kid is very annoying & really cant act at all I sure most sane film-goers will disagree with my opinions but I still stand by the fact that I liked it & would happily watch it again Witchery is pretty good fun & definitely worth a watch if your into bad films or your a horror fan in general
I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual horror movie again I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the Exorcist movies (Which i loved) What was up with all of those nasty B-movies she did? br br David Hassellhoff on the other hand all i could do is laugh He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor David needs to stick to Knight Rider or Baywatchbr br All around this is an awesome movie Even for the eighties this was an awesome film It has horror action and drama It is a suspenseful and I loved the way Linda Blair turned out
During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it Something like: Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism?br br So my comprehension of this movie was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism When recently seeing this movie in the TV-version I had this filter before me and it wasnt difficult to see thisbr br Strangely enough I havent met this way of interpreting the film ever since I first heard itbr br These are the things I found in Four shades of brown In all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster:br br 1 The crematory-worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them In the crematory-room in dealing with death and fire its almost like a cheerful game to him The seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy accordingly in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures his father severelybr br Possible lesson: The importance of showing the young adequate emotions When they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to goodbr br 2The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer Just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand reaching for personality integrity and joy he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despairbr br Their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to his parents bad taste The real problem he is carrying within is far from comprehensible to him: His fathers behavior passes on when suffocating his own wife in his spotless environmentbr br Possible lesson: Oppression breeds bondagebr br 3The father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to his children when he cheats them on their inheritance He robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritancebr br Possible lesson: When no love given you cannot give anybr br 4The fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression Here the ice cold Nazi-sadism becomes very obvious in physical violence It gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young scin-head-nazists behavior when oppressing others br br Possible lesson? : Can Nazism take birth in a pervert home?br br Can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life in the long run be that room is given to sadistic Nazism ?br br Very seldom does a movie contains so much It reveals little by little as I meditate on it I consider it brilliantly painted and the actors are superb Especially the nice-seeming bloke played by Ulf Brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all
This movie must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four odd story about love or career I would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended br br Also the unique pause in the middle is something Ive never seen beforebr br Cant wait for the series (if theyre doing one) or the extended DVD Apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 35 hours
I didnt know what to expect from this hugely popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy & satire team as they released their first feature film More broad satire? Well we do get four contemporary exceptionally memorable tales of family pains generation gaps and fatherhood in particular But its drama thankfully and what drama! Epic in its scope as each episode is from carefully picked geographically different parts of Sweden But each story could seriously carry a whole movie if expanded separatelybr br Its dark twisted harrowing yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed Script acting and cinematography are absolute world class as three hours seem to get by in a blink! Its four shades of mastery and easily one of the best films in the nations cinema history Its Swedens answer to Short cuts or Magnolia if you like and instantly on par with those!br br 9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
Never ever have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people that faces a crisis or many In some ways a little like Short Cuts but totally different at the same timebr br There are a heap of lead characters whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold and they are as persons show their good and their bad sides their weaknesses and their strengths with lots of drama and laughterbr br The closest equivalent in a US movie I can think of which then is far weaker in every respect is the Royal Tenenbaums br br Four Shades of Brown as the title would be in English tells the story about a stressed out hotelier and his wife and his elderly parents (who are traveling magicians); about the receptionist at an animal crematory and his family misadventures; about the members of a cooking course (who mostly talk about their sorry lives) and fourthly about the funeral for a womanizing trotter jockey who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond the grave by singing and appearing in 3D during the funeral thanks to high tech equipment that has cost his entire fortune (the family gets nil not even the famous horse is given to the family)!br br There is a warmth and compassion in this film that is filled with grief and laughter that Ive never experienced beforebr br Most actors were new to me except Robert Gustafsson and one or two more but they all deserve the big slam the film took at the Swedish Guldbagge extravaganza (= the Swedish Oscar Awards) a week ago!br br Male female and male supporting actor prizes went to this film plus a few more to boot!br br If you have the chance go and see it - the hours float by very quickly!
This movie is about London and its an amazing movie it will be released on DVD in april 2003 and I will buy it when it gets out so If you have not seen it until then BUY IT The music in the movie is even better (saint etienne) have done the soundtrack
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London I was very excited to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival This movie has great shots an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a not so well known Londonbr br The movie is held completely in dark colours which I personally dont like too much Furthermore the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes got a little flat Other than that there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots FINISTERRE doesnt glorify London by showing all the great attractions of the city but rather gives deep insights in what London is really like From the East end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the special little retreats for Londonersbr br All in all:br br +Great Soundtrack +Nice shots +great insightsbr br -Narration -Tiering to watch at times -Very dark picturebr br Worth watching! I give it a 710
I absolutely LOVED this movie! Since I dont want to give much away its basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together Its very heartwarming story between the struggles they have I also think Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the entire film! This is definitely worth seeing! Two thumbs up way up!
I just saw this movie tonight Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman alot and Susan Sarandon is a great actor too but it was way better than I could have imagined You come out of the movie feeling great The acting was excellent which is something that can be hard to come by lately Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor Anyways back on subject the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and I definitely think that everyone should go see it I would give more details but I dont want to give away the movie
I just came back from seeing this awesome movie!! I can relate to it so muchIt reminded me when my sister had to go to college we had to move from place to place and my mom acts like Adele August! Boys might not like this movie since it brings tears to your eyes One of the best real-life movies Ive ever seen!! and Natalie Portman rules!! 1010
Im sorry but Star Wars Episode 1 did not do any justice to Natalie Portmans talent (and undeniable cuteness) She was entirely underused as Queen Amidala and when she was used her makeup was frighteningly terrible For Anywhere But Here she sheds her god-awful makeup and she acts normally And not only can she act good she looks good doing it Im a bit older than she (shes only 18) and I have little or no chance of meeting her but hey a guy is allowed to dream right?br br Even though Susan Sarandon does take a good turn in this movie the film belongs entirely to Portman Ive been a watcher of Portmans since Beautiful Girls (where she was younger but just as cute) Theres big things for her in the future - I can see it
Adam Sandlers movies are my favorite comedies The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie The Matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie Anywhere But Here is my favorite dramabr br Perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is its actingbr br Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing By the end of this movie I felt as if I knew her character better than I knew myself She did a simply amazing jobbr br Natalie Portman also did a great job I recently rented her first movie Leon (1994) in which she played a 12 year old girl I believe that she is a contradiction in terms; she was a good kid actress Well 5 years later she is still just as good an actress In fact shes much betterbr br Not only did Sarandon and Portman portray their characters well but they also worked perfectly together I mean even now I can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this moviebr br This movie is about a 14 year old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) that leave their home town in Wisconsin for Beverly Hillsbr br At first Portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years (usually down might I add)br br Although this explanation is a little vague the plot can only be summarized vaguely But when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak for it is actually very deep What I am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly but then they focus in on it to make it strongbr br And it is very strong but also the plot sequencing is great And there are a few brilliant scenes that I hope will someday be seen as classicbr br I loved this movie I laughed I cried And although admittedly there are a few loopholes its still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end
Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly!! I related to the character Ann August more than most would My Mother isnt AS eccentric as Adele but the feelings of lonliness is the same This movie is perfect in the ating aspects and Natalies and Susans performances are so linked together that its the best onscreen dual i have seen in years Their chemistry brings the characters to life they become real people! I would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away Because there is genually alot of people out there who would wish to be Anywhere But Here including me! and if you can see this movie with your best friend or your mother Its the tears that blend everyone around you together more!!
Its the best movie I have seen in 2000 it has the beautiful and talented Natalie Portman in it It has a great storyline cast and soundtrack I enjoyed it very much 10 out of 10
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman I had to see the movie I enjoyed every minute of it It plays out in a very sincere way Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother Susans character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of itbr br I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some-guy (hes in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed And I think that is great I think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the filmbr br Natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because I havent seen her in a bad film yet So any movie that has Natalie Portman will no doubt be seen by mebr br A good film 710
Most families will recognise similarities between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon Natalie creates an on screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and one worthy of a Golden Globe Nomination The control of her emotions are so in tact that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene Susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different to any other and carries it through with true professionalismbr br Any Natalie fan wouldve seen the film based on her past successes but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film It is a truly humbling experience
Susan Sarandon She made this movie for me Ive never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie She really acted as though she were Adele August I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character whos truly believable br br Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheralbr br I gave this movie an eight rating but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance As far as relationship movies go Beaches and Terms of Endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie but I highly recommend it
it´s a movie to see on tv and only once i mean it´s good but it´s a little too lengthy and the plot is so well-known it isn´t very original but it isn´t boring the best thing of the movie are the performances natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a great job i give it a 7
I was laying in bed flicking through the channels and boy do I have channels 500 of them With over 70 movie channels I probably watch a movie on cable once or twice a month DVD has spolied mebr br Anyway Im flicking through and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman I take interest 110 minutes later I am still interested How could this be? When I first saw the previews to this movie in the theater I remember making fun of it I never thought Id watch it nevermind like itbr br The story is based on a book and you can tell The movie is very episodic andits not like the movie has a great plot it just sucks you in May-be its that performances that do it Im pretty sure in must have beenbr br This movie was good for no reasonbr br Peters Movie Rating (out of 10): 7
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script Susan Sarandon plays the part of a flighty irrational and possessive mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood The daughter is dubious but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strongbr br In time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground She sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome seductive guy who loves em and leaves em She sees that the mother doesnt get it So how can she look to her mother for guidance?br br The mother directs the girl to a drama try-out and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly-by-night mother This causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic but the lesson takes holdbr br There is character-growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is persuaded to let the girl go It is a touching scene and a valuable lesson that parents however emotionally dependent have to let the child go and become her own separate person
Anywhere But Here is not exactly anything new but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills California in search of a better life The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie would much rather have stayed in Wisconsin with all of her friends and family and she felt that she was forced to go to California with her overbearing mother br br (spoilers) While its true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new Anywhere But Here doesnt cover any new ground but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again Also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years seen on Natalie Portmans face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about Natalies mother pressing her to become an actress as well as a very convincing performance from Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalies very close cousins from back home His death is a tragic cliché almost always seen in movies like this one but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this Not great but Anywhere But Here is definitely worth a look
Chick Flick? Of course Been done before? Many times Predictable? Yes Worth watching? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portmans portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line I am a great fan of motherdaughter stories What makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones ARE the performances and the character development Although this is not the BEST of its genre I will buy it and watch it again I felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top dramas brought upon us by Hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failed(especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of Natalie Portman) this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both Susan and Natalie share They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities I feel that these two actress talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar (full of cliches) and really saved the suffering plot I would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such over-the-top dramas
I thought Anywhere But Here was a good movieIt stars two wonderful actresses Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman which when I heard they were in a movie together I resist watching itOverall it was a pretty enjoyable movieIt had its moments where I felt as if they tried to hard and there was also some really overdone and worn-out material but there wasnt anything in the movie that I absolutely hatedI even liked how they used the pop-up performance of the uncredited Thora Birch and all the little happysad moments are touching and effectiveIf you want to watch this movie go ahead because even though I dont recommend it its not something you should avoid and a 59 rating seems unfair in my opinion
This film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoilsbr br Anywhere But Here is an engaging film from beginning to the end Both Ann and Adele are described well right at the start so we get to know how different their personalities are Clashes inevitably ensue and they are engagingly presented I find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances it is as if I am living their lives feeling what they are feelingbr br Susan Sarandon gives another excellent performance in Anywhere But Here She is charismatic happy go lucky hedonistic warm and loving all at once I have always liked Susan Sarandon and I think she is grossly underratedbr br Anywhere But Here is a captivating emotional journey
The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman She gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth Susan Sarandon a fine actress is suitably sincere as the mother figure I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script I am not saying the script was bad in any way I am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times I dont think it was the script writers fault The film did suffer from being overlong and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes The film does look beautiful with some good direction and excellent performances All in all watchable certainly but maybe more for an older audience 710 Bethany Cox
Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother Adele (Susane Sarandon) Thats how the movie begins Adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter Its really deep and touching thanks to the great work of the actresses Natalie was nominated to a Golden Globe for that role She is one of the most talented actresses I ever saw and so is Sarandon They really look like mother daughter The soundtrack is also great The movie is incredible 10 out of 10
I was able to see Anywhere But Here last night as a free sneak preview I absolutely LOVED the film! I was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a motherdaughter relationshipthere was definitely a connection between Adele a and Ann I think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman Sarandon was just the right actress to portray Adele and after leaving the theater I could not think of another actress in the role Portman was also excellent as Ann She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I dont think any other teenage actress could I think it would the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both Sarandon and Portman for Awards in the Actress and Supporting Actress categories It would be a shame if they were overlooked
My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film but this is not true I did enjoy the movie but was probably expecting too muchbr br Adele who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon did not come off as a very likable character She is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail Adeles daughter Anna is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mothers shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old This of course makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna since she never seems to be 14- 17 years old either Portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years Yet even with the two solid leads Wayne Wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more so with Smoke Though I have not read the book the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story I enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work but I never got lost in the experience and I never related to their plight
Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter Sarandon has this ability call it talent if you will to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes As the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl Sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer More importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over Portmans portrayal of the daughter The question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot who changes? This film is certainly about the daughter but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that Mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter I am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also The hallmark of fine drama
Being a freshman in college this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom Of course my situation doesnt parrallel with Natalie Portman and Surandons situation; but my mom and I have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights There is always the mother telling you what to do or not being the kind of mother you want to be I was balling my eyes at the end of this movie Surandons reaction of her daughter going to the East coast miles away after all theyve been through reminded me of how I felt being from a small city in the West coast going to New York br br The movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up It is very touching I was moved by the movie Every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real you didnt get any phony sentimentality I was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie alone wishing my mother was sitting next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything This movie is a bit corny of course but everything is trully momentous Its all about what a mom can learn from her child; and what a child learns from her mother 810
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship It is a family story that isnt dulled down by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is I couldnt help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends The acting was quite exquisite and I hope well be seeing both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles down the road
Well I have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film Natalie Portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother-daughter relationship film br br Beautiful film
This film was a new direction for Natalie Portman A much more adult role though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself Ann(Portman) and Susan Sarandon who plays her newly divorced mother Adele travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to Beverly Hills There these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as Portmans character grows up Unknowingly at first to Adele she grows up and becomes a better mother for itbr br Ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress or so she thinks Adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives We see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone having left their old lives behindbr br The acting is top notch from both of them They seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes You can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual moviebr br Though this movie really doesnt take us to any new ground in these types of films the fact that the acting is well done and the story isnt too flawed lets me recommend itbr br I will say however it will probably go away soon I dont believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge Christmas season of movies starting in a week or so See it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses
Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August a single mother whos the working definition of the word dreamer and her solemn pragmatic daughter Adele wanting to make a fresh start in a big city moves them from Wisconsin to Californiabr br Decent if not exceptional or particularly memorable with some serious and sad moments It pushes some emotional buttons thats for sure Best thing it offers is a solid cast and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at timesbr br Could be better could be worsebr br I gave this one seven out of ten
Wayne Wangs direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than Slums of Beverly Hills which covers remarkably similar ground The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting Real chemistry there This film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration Susan Sarandons character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent She amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic And Natalie Portman deflects each attack on her characters ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child untainted by the smug cynicism of the Natasha Lyonne character in Slums of Beverly Hills Portmans character is an adolescent with dignity under stress an unusual creature in modern films The film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard I highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained
A MUST SEE documentary-----This movie had so many things to consider while watching it It was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named Brenton Butler He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida It shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing The police little to investigate the crime Brentons lawyer Patrick McGuinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client He tells the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beatings against his young client to get him to confess The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was questioned McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored He questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard Brenton say to one of the investigators and he challenges their own words McGuinness investigates with Ann Finnell each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not The movie shows the Butlers as a loving Christian family who have faith in their sons innocence and faith that God will set Brenton free They visit him in jail and pray with him there to encourage him There are scenes of group prayer for Brenton the lawyers the Judge and everyone involved in this case I am a white and I was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks It was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man Police have a hard job and I believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie I think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the Judicial system including Judges police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it
I saw this movie last night on HBO & didnt expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO But it happened & you will too Its a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville Florida and subsequent investigation arrest & trial of a 15 year old boybr br Watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society This film was most deserving of an esteemed Oscar - youll be moved to tears
This is an extraordinary film As a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the American justice system its frightening For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court In truth the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty or a guilty man being free Every citizen has a right to justice whether a perpetrator or a victim But do they get it? The film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries Ive seen
Art imitates life imitates art Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the DA in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again The music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience
Anyone that is looking for an episode of Law and Order or CSI would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this casebr br A murder took place and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it? Sure the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently He must have shrunk reversed his age by 5-10 years and changed clothesbr br The police made absolutely no effort - and they admitted it! The did no forensics on any of the evidence they questioned no other witnesses and they beat a confession out of a 15-year-oldbr br The saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in Jacksonville Florida Let everyone now start talking about Southern justice
Very good film Very good documentarybr br Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted narcissistic heartless swines their one eyed parents community and environment raised them asbr br I tip my lid to Pat McGuinness Can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation? We need his integrity endurance intelligence clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big businessbr br All the animals come out at night - whores skunk pussies buggers queens fairies dopers junkies sick venal Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets Pat McGuinness should be the first drops of that real rain The people who control this earth are animals They need to be drownedbr br Im just in shock Walking the night is scary business The inhuman howling and cackling is of detectives in Murder On A Sunday Morning In Pat McGuinness blazing spotlight they look horribly caught horribly guilty and ready for a just and horrible drowningbr br It is exceptionally satisfying in a world in which the punters play a rigged game to see justice done and to see every narcissistic felon drown like the pathetic human rats they arebr br How does it feel you railroading abominable snaky fingers of the law? How does it feel to have your rigged prosecution your rigged confession your rigged detective work found out for what it really was? How does it feel? br br I hope it twists like a knife you miserable one eyed nothings
You think the police are always rightbr br You believe that eye-witnesses are always rightbr br You believe the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98% of a basic investigationbr br You believe a US city might have a few bad apples in law enforcement but that the good cops will quickly nip those who systematically engage in evil-for-evils sake in the budbr br You believe that the possibility of an ex-football lineman being instated as a detective solely because his dad is the county sheriff and being allowed to beat confessions out of randomly-selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to himself could happen in the America of the 1930s but not todaybr br You believe a judge will NOT send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer-by nabbed by the police because it was hot and they did not feel like working that daybr br You believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are exceptions to the rule and an injustice like this could NEVER involve your family member someone in the middle class or someone like YOUbr br You think that you are aware of every terrible indisputable 100% proved outrage of the last 10 years in America--yet you havent seen this film
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramasbr br The story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville FL murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victims husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coercedbr br About half the footage is of the trial; its supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case interviewing witnesses and visiting key locations This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition and placed in logical order The camera work is pretty solid And theres a mildly surprising epilogue
with that carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess: lying deception laziness the list goes onbr br However as an American I was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in todays police force as is reflected with the Duval County Sheriff Departments horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year old accused black youth I shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their abusive work while a young mans LIFE hung in the crooked balance of justicebr br However there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly-paid public defenders stuck by their guns (irony intended) and forced the truth from the detectives I wanted to fly down to Florida and tell anybody with influence what a great public defender team they have in Duval County; those lawyers care about the little man and most importantly for justicebr br The other story line is about faith and family Praises to the accuseds family and their strong Christian (submit any dedicated religion) beliefs and wonderful family values I hope they win their lawsuit against the Duval County Sheriffs Departmentbr br Bravo for justice!!! Bravo for the little guy!!!
I watched this movie with my mother She is 81 yrsold and was raised to be a bigot She even acknowledges this I dont think she really understood what was happening she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty Scary I felt for this child and his family What torture they went through and remained faithful That is true faith Back to the movie I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him I could tell when one the cops was lying He would not look the defender in the eyes His eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin I read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men They were finally found guilty after many years I cant remember the title but it was the same premise Whites doing whatever they want with blacks I am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time if not forever I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white No comment from her I want to commend the director and producer of this film I feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project I am an avid viewer of indy films I feel that they are well written and have substance I am pleased that I happened to grab this movie on the shelf I felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly I feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society
I just saw the movie through Netflix I was intrigued by the way the movie was described but in the end it was better I was moved in many different directions while watching this movie I was filled with hurt hate angry bitternesspain and finally relief To look at the young man accused would break your heart and convince you that they had the wrong person The smugness of the police makes you cring because just as the Rodney King Beating brought to light the brutality of the police this movie brings forth the total lack of moral fiber in these police And the fact that they beat this boy and got away with it only infuriates you morebr br But I have to tell you I fell in love with the attorney Mc Guinness One of my favorite lines when he was telling us what an ahole on of the cops was The cop told him to go on keep sucking on that cancer stick Mc Guinness told the cop I always have a cigarette before sex I was letting him know I was going to screw himbr br I have a new respect for some of the law in this country
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsiquent court case that follows What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wifeThe star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along Fascinating stuff 7 out of 10
I happened to leave HBO on last night following Six Feet Under What ran next has left me speechless What an incredible piece of work I dont just recommend this I MANDATE that you see this Its better than anything Hollywood could ever ruin I just hope they never get their hands on it
I dont need to say much about how good this documentary is--its truly an amazing piece of true narrative The story is simple enough: a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in Florida and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and put on trial with only the public defender and his family on his side Its very enthralling and the public defender is a joy to watch in all his human ways--you cant help but pull for the triumph of justice and the ending fulfills more than could be expected of a true storybr br Its a shame more people havent seen this documentary but hopefully you will find a way to watch it For those interested in race relations in the United States and the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process its well worth your time and effort to find this documentary I give it a 10
You know before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases I mean if they were arrested and charged they must have been guilty I reasoned?br br I formed this opinion over some years You see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of Sydney He frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to bleeding heart lawyers and magistrates He would bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be back on the street by noon It took its toll they wore him down He quitbr br He has argued since not unreasonably I thought that creative evidence gathering to keep the baddies where they belong was well acceptable br br My arguments about the rights of innocent people werent valid he claimed What are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime? he would argue And being a law abiding citizen the weight of his argument convinced me he was right The chances of me or any of my family or friends being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none I thought br br Hmmmmm Well as mentioned earlier seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that br br Im sending him a copy
I absolutely adored this movie For me the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like Boston Legal or Ally McBeal or even LA Law This is REALITY The law is not BS won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt like the Chewbacca defense on South Park) This is a real travesty of justice the legal system gone horribly wrong and the work by GOOD lawyers - not the shyster stereotype who use all of their skills to right it It will do more for restoring your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra movie or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD And most importantly I wept During the film during the featurette included at the end of the DVD - its amazing Wonderful film; wonderfully made Thank God the filmmakers made it
Im pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it cant be accused of unfair bias With absolutely no cause the Jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white foreign tourist They picked a 15 yr old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him In addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager It makes one question whether as a society we should compensate those who are charged imprisoned and subsequently found innocent This docudrama is well produced professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you wont want to take a 1 minute break If you care about social justice dont miss this one It certainly deserved its Oscar
This is a pretty obscure dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades It is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing I dont know It is mesmerizing I was impressed with the night time scenes because it actually looked like night unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule There are a few scenes towards the end the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool This movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat I was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be I couldnt take my eyes off of it and I had to ask myself why?
I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic Also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan who also plays the part of Jarvis in the film In listening to recent blogtalkradio show called the AARF show(Robert Morgan is a co-host)he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and suchthere are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film I think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more Robert is a good man and I hope it does well He has devoted 50+ years of tireless work as a Sassquatch Researcher(which is also one of my interests)and author Check out his show on the paranormal and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II sometime in the near future
Quality entertainment all around The spectacle of Kermit on his bicycle is one thats as memorable as ANY in cinema history Theres just not a bad thing to be said Tons of muppets great cameos slapstick puns whatever you want its here The lovers the dreamers and me INDEED
First of all before I start my review I just read every review for The Muppet Movie here and I cant believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this (Fortunately there was only one) I mean I can understand how someone may not like Star Wars due to the whole Sci-Fi genre but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad br br Okay I will step off my soapbox now and review this moviebr br The Muppet Movie came out when I was seven All of my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie so I think I saw it about four times in the first month in theatersbr br As a child many things attracted me to this and all the other Muppet movies & TV shows The singing was probably the main one Most of the songs in The Muppet Movie are classics From Rainbow Connection to Im Going to Go Back There Someday theyre entertaining and thought-provokingbr br As an adult I see The Muppet Movie in almost a whole different light Yes the things that thrilled me about it as a kid are still there but its the little jokes and such that are just plain hilariousbr br I mean when you think about it Jim Henson is a sick man br br Kermit is a frog and that is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and could karate chop you into two pieces Fozzie is a stand-up comedian bear Gonzo is a whatever that is infatuated with chickens Then you have two old guys that heckle a piano-playing dog a rock band with a maniac drummer a Swedish chef that you cant understand and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentricbr br Yet for these reasons and more Henson has entertained millions of children and adults giving us all something special to watch and remember him by br br The Muppet Movie will always remain in my heart for many reasons but I think the biggest one is because its a movie unlike a lot of recent childrens movies that I feel comfortable to have my kids watch Plus I dont get bored out of my mind with jokes that are dumbed down to my kids levelbr br Its a great movie that is sure to be remembered forever
This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny entertaining sweet and memorable its difficult to decide where to startbr br From the opening number Rainbow Connection Paul Williamss excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D Frog which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about throughout the story this is one fun moviebr br Essentially its a road trip movie where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain Along the way our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors comedians singers and musicians who coincidentally are muppets like Kermit himself Is this how the Muppets really started? Approximately how it happened Kermit tells usbr br Not since Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World has the cameo formula been used so prolifically and successfully The aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just blink across the screen but others have very memorable cameos Steve Martins amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best Puppeteer Jim Hensons nod to his inspiration Edgar Bergen is especially touchingbr br Anyone who ever watched the Muppets TV show will get to see all of their favorite characters theyre all here The puppetry work is magnificent; look especially for Kermit riding a bicycle (how dey do dat???) In-jokes and references to old movies are everywhere but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit himself An example: when the crooks are terrorizing Kermit and Piggy she affectionately says to her short green and handsome beau I wouldnt give up this evening together for anything would you? Uhhh make me an offer I also love the gunfight at the OK Corral scene: brilliantly absurd sillinessbr br Gotta get Movin right along now but to summarize: a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age or movie genre taste Highly recommended
This is a movie that will brighten up your day for sure Kermit the Frog is just an ordinary frog in his swamp when a talent agent stops by and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to be in movie (lol) On the way Kermit meets Fozzie Bear Miss Piggy Gonzo and his chicken Camilla Rowlf The Electric Mayhem Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker But also trailing Kermit is the proprietor of a restaurant chain Doc Hoppers French Fried Frog Legs All things considered though Kermit and the Muppets make it to Hollywoodbr br This movie is recommended for everyone young and oldbr br It has some wonderful musical numbers like The Rainbow Connection Im Going to go Back There Someday and Movin Right Along The Muppets also use many forms of transportation in this movie Kermit rides a bike Fozzie drives a Studebaker and another car Gonzo takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons (which is one of my favorite moments by the way ;) ) and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally go the rest of the way by the Electric Mayhems bus (Dr Teeth Floyd Janice Scooter and Animal); who meet up with them in the desert after Fozzies car breaks downbr br Even some Sesame Street Muppets make cameo appearances (ie Big Bird is walking along on the road on the way to NYC to break into public television) The end is also a very heartwarming moment Every single Muppet created is in the final scene along with a final Rainbow Connection reprisebr br But those poor Muppets worked so hard on their movie set then it all comes crashing down and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks Youd think everything is ruined and destroyed But the rainbow comes shining through the roof at the end and it all sums up the magic of this film and you know everything will be all rightbr br Perfect 1010 Watch it and youll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie
As Muppet movies go this is easily and clearly the best It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age a solid script and some great Disneyesque songs and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Hensons talent The story is basic and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirablebr br This is simply fun but it is also a well made well written beautifully endearing classicbr br It rates an 8910 frombr br the Fiend :
Looking back on Jim Hensons works years after his death is like taking a look back into another time For unlike most so-called creative types attempting to sell to or worse yet cynically exploit children nowadays Jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child And if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this Labyrinth aside it is 1979s Muppet Movie Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson came to work in childrens television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half-hour show of his own on primetime television The Muppet Movie ends up an affirmation of everything more progressive understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s And as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and bound from speaking about anything lest someone might get offended the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of The Muppet Show is on offer here I have said it in other comments but I must say it here A great light in the world went out the day Jim Henson diedbr br The Muppet Movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next eighty or so minutes In short precise strokes we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors And when the story proper begins boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment The Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets especially Kermit were These were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show They were living things based upon a part of all of us only writ so much more boldly than we are used to As each Muppet was introduced to us in turn we saw another reflection of part of ourselves and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character Hence everyone had a favourite When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal I knew I had found one of mine Nowadays I am more of a Swedish Chef fan but what the heybr br Complementing the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities Can You Picture That? shared an insight into Dr Teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of Henson But the most relevant song to me was Gonzos number asking what he is and where he came from Many of us would spend a lifetime gazing into the stars and like Gonzo saying we knew we would be going back there someday Not that all the songs were so deadly serious of course Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent (or lack thereof) and hit the road If any evidence were required that present-day musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable this number would be it Never before and never again would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another With the puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game the human cast had a lot to live up tobr br Which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal Cameos literally pepper the film with everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas popping in to offer their support Even Richard Pryor the last man one would expect to see in a film about the Muppets appears to set up a hilarious moment Mel Brooks cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when I was a small boy but I suspect that is because Henson knew why I would find it disturbing now The big acting strength though comes from Charles Durning who as Doc Hopper embodies everything both Henson and his audience determined to resist At every junction Hopper comes to either offer Kermit the chance to sell out and betray his own kind Or perhaps offer stops being the right word when Hoppers attempts to ensure Kermits compliance become progressively more forceful and violent The whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the worldbr br Of course Animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them any less of a friend In point of fact Animal turns out to be the best friend that Kermit has in that moment And that has been the core message of every good show or film Henson has been involved in ever since That shunning or dismissing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes There can be little doubt that in todays world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authorities Hensons creature workshop could never have got off the ground To misquote the album title daring to be stupid is one thing but enforcing the choice upon others is another matter The Muppet Movie demonstrates how Henson dared to ask us all to think both inside and outside of the proverbial box There will never be another entirely like him but he never would want us to stop tryingbr br Therefore The Muppet Movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film If we were to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated this would be it
I first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters way back when Seeing it again nearly 30 years later I was surprised at how well it has held up The gags are still funny the interaction between characters works great and the cameos come off better than ever (Steve Martins has to be the best one) br br My kids (9 11 and 14) all loved it and the music is good enough that they are still humming the tunes many days laterbr br I would suggest that before seeing the movie you should view at least a half-dozen episodes of the Muppet Show to get a sense of the back-story behind the characters otherwise the movie wont make all that much sense
The Muppet movie is an instant classic I remember the opening scene with the birds eye view of the swamp and Kermit starting into (in my opinion) the most loved song in the history of songs At this point my mom would always sing along with Kermitbr br Watching this title as a young adult it makes me smile I can still sing along to my hearts desire Like many Muppet films there are in jokes for adults that are( In my opinion) still funny today My favorite line of all time is actually from this film its the last line spoken by my green goggle eyed hero Kermit Lifes like a movie  Write your own ending Thats what I intend to do! Thank you Jim Henson
Why are there so many songs about rainbows and whats on the other side? Kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of The Muppet Movie while singing his signature song The Rainbow Connection As time goes by the question and the movie only gain profunditybr br Im going to forgo the review of this movie as a childrens comedy but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing yearbr br As the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me I hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyones life because we all dream And that is what this movie is about Its not just a bunch of puppets-- its a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams which is a good lesson for everyonebr br And while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good theyre not a fair judge of the movie Only The Rainbow Connection and the powerful emotions it will realize And it all fits in: Rainbow Connection is the Muppet Movie and vice versa Its existentialism meets childrens entertainment-- theres no simpler way to describe it
A delight from start to finishbr br If you dont like the Muppets then I just have to feel sorry for you This terrific film doesnt simply cash in on the Muppets popularity -- its a well-conceived and well-written film in its own right Its got great songs and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in Jim Hensons creations and which is most personified in the character of Kermit the Frog I always responded to this as a kid and its what makes the Muppets still enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me crazybr br A huge cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this film feel like a kiddie-sized version of Around the World in 80 Days except that its about 80 times betterbr br Grade: A
I enjoyed THE MUPPET MOVIE very much It was the first of the Muppet movies and is by far the best because its so creative and fresh With later films the ideas just didnt seem quite so original But here we get to see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding bikes (an incredibly difficult scene) an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun I loved every minute the Muppets were performing and I would have rated the film a lot higher except for one serious problem In this and most subsequent Muppet films some powers that be felt there was a need to include lots of non-Muppets--in particular many many cameos by stars Some worked fine (such as Charles Durnings) but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding halt Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan Yes he was an amazing man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew but the tiny scene hes in just wasnt needed nor were most of the cameos Still despite this big complaint its a great film for the entire family--from the kids to even the most demanding adults
The first feature-length adventure of Jim Hensons beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree swampy surroundings for the bright lights (egged on by stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who overheard him singing); on the way he meets Fozzie Bear (a pitiful stand-up comedian at James Coburns El Sleazo Café who has Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn a patron!) the piano-playing dog Rowlf bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back funky band egomaniacal beauty queen Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presided over by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen) etc All the while Kermit et al are pursued by frogleg burger magnate Charles Durning and reluctant acolyte Austin Pendleton sold cars ice cream and balloons to by respectively Milton Berle Bob Hope and Richard Pryor served food by insolent waiter Steve Martin nearly brainwashed by mad German scientist Mel Brooks and finally land an audition in the offices of movie mogul Orson Welles (who has Cloris Leachman for a secretary)! The pleasant song score comes courtesy of Paul Williams who also makes an appearance as the resident pianist at El Sleazos For the record I have recently acquired four of the subsequent Muppet movies and should be watching them in the weeks to come when their turn falls due
Ive Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie But Just The Half Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kellys Friends House The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious They Learn That If They Believe In The End Of The Rainbow Anyone Can Make It No Matter How Small No Matter How Green(Which Was Included In The Trailer)br br Kermit Is My Favorite Protagonist(Which Means It Describes The Main Character) And So Are The Other Muppets Mel Brooks Was Amazing When He Played Professor Max Krassman The Scene Where Miss Piggy Saves Kermit By Doing Kung Fu On Those Guys It Was So Coolbr br The Muppet Movie Is The Best Jim Henson Film With The Most Hilarious Characters And People Will Cherish For His Successful Film
If I rate the film maybe a bit high you can blame it on sentiment This is one of the first movies that I remember seeing and totally loving I saw it at the drive-ins here in California in the late 70s I was already a big fan of The Muppet Show on TV so I was primed for the movie and the movie did not disappoint Basically it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from vaudeville into a road movie Kermit the Frog is on a quest to become famous; not because he wants to take champagne baths and ride in a private jet but because he wants to make millions of people happy Of coursebr br Along the way he picks up all his beloved muppet friends most endearingly Fonzie Bear who he meets at a seedy bar doing stand-up They sing Movin Right Along a song that has always charmed me with its upbeat melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery He also encounters enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie including comedy luminaries like Richard Pryor Steve Martin Edgar Bergen Milton Berle and Mel Brooks Brooks in particular has a rather dull bit and you are left feeling that Henson could have cut a few of these cameos out if he wasnt afraid of offending the stars Anyway as befits a road trip movie like this the very first person he meets is Dom DeLuisebr br The ending is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the 4th wall that you will find in any childrens movie The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling all about them when a real rainbow pierces the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery Im sure this was meant to relate to some of Jim Hensons own personal or spiritual experiencesbr br This is the best movie with Muppets by a long shot If you or anyone else was wondering why the Muppets were so popular back in the 70s considering how poor the movies have been for the last few decades I think this film has at least aged well enough to provide a clue
The Muppet Movie br br directed by br br James Frawleybr br Kermit the Frog and friends relive the tales and stories of how they all came togetherbr br The Muppets star in their first feature film bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture The story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts The well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction The cameos arent just thrown in either but written in as interesting characters making one of the many peaks for our furry friends
I am 17 and a biased Muppet fan and while I love Treasure Island Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them It is enormously entertaining thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl and the film looks lovely with some beautifully staged musical numbers Speaking of the songs I really liked them sure they arent the best song score out of the Muppet franchise but they were very nice to listen to especially Never Before Never Before is now one of my favourite Muppet songs along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate The Muppets as usual were fantastic particularly the always delightful Miss Piggy and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was great And what a brilliant human cast- from Bob Hope to Orson Welles from Madeleine Kahn(the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like Whats Up Doc? Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor all of whom made memorable guest appearances if careful not to overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic film 1010 Bethany Cox
Who doesnt remember The Muppet Movie???br br Kermit the Frog is now an American culture icon What child doesnt appeal to this character?br br As the first actual Muppet film the movie simply called The Muppet Movie did very well Kermit takes a Hollywood agents advice and goes out of his home swamp to respond to the ad Along the way he meets up with a pig a bear chickens a rock band and a few other quality puppets Watch for dozens of cameo appearances like Madaline Kahn Steve Martian Richard Pryor Mel Brooks and several more I grew up watching this movie and I loved it
A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets created by Jim Henson & Co have been made but The Muppet Movie was the first one of them all and the first in the original trilogy which also features The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan It was released seven years before I was born so I obviously didnt get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released) However I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood mostly after Hensons premature death in 1990 I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties after hearing the soundtrack Unsurprisingly I liked it at the time and revisiting it in recent years hasnt exactly been disappointingbr br One day while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing Rainbow Connection a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown Kermit takes his advice and goes west He soon meets Fozzie Bear an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant and convinces him to come along The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot As a frog Kermit is disgusted by this so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie On their road trip across the country Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermits love interest) and Gonzo Unfortunately as they all try to make their way to Hollywood Doc Hopper assisted by Max is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chains mascot so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger! br br One thing many people praise this film for is the songs and I can understand why There is of course the Oscar-nominated Rainbow Connection at the beginning and more good tunes follow such as Kermit and Fozzies catchy road song Movin Right Along and Im Going to Go Back There Someday a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo Never Before Never Again the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit is the only one I would consider rather weak and their romance seems awfully sudden The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable just like they are on TV and some of them provide a lot of the humour including Fozzie making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up and well if youre familiar with these famous Muppets you should know what to expect from each of them Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the Insolent Waiter Also its not 100% comedy There are serious parts of the film which they also did wellbr br Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing Muppets from Space (one of the Muppet movies made after Hensons death released in 1999) for the first time last year I was very disappointed when I saw that film which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters! Not only is that movie not very funny I also think its a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets as I stated in my review of it! However I cant say I think the same of any of that movies predecessors including this one released twenty years earlier The Muppet Movie seems to be the most popular of the bunch and since it has so much to like not just for kids thats understandable I highly doubt theres much left to say about The Muppet Movie that hasnt been said at some point in the past thirty years but today it remains good family entertainment
I have always loved The Muppets Though most childrens entertainment then wasnt that likable The Muppets was The Muppets are very very funny They are probably the most likable childrens characters ever br br Not only did The Muppets have their own show They also have starred in many films from The Muppets Christmas carol to The Muppets treasure Island The first Muppets movie The Muppet movie was also like the show and the other films excellentbr br The Muppet movie is about how they all got started Kermit the frog used to live in a swamp Until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood So Kermit takes off for Hollywood Along the way he runs into lots of people such as Fozzie Bear Gonzo the great and Miss Piggy Also an evil man is trying to capture Kermitbr br All of the Muppet films are highly enjoyable I mean they are all very funny This film has many film appearances Such as Steve Martin Mel Brooks Elliot Gould Carol Kane Richard Pryor and Orson Welles The Muppet films are all very enjoyable I hear that Jason Segel is going to star in one soon I cant wait to see it
I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10br br The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood The laughs and gags are classic muppetism I am glad these films are still around for the next generation I hope I never out grow the magic of the muppets
This film is one of my fondest childhood memories Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading Hollywood singing and dancing with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit Fozzie Bear doing his best as everyones manager and a generous cast of extras delivering a film that turned out to be okey dokeybr br Kermits melancholy ukulele number Rainbow Connection was nominated for an Oscar that year but was beat out by Norma Raes It Goes Like It Goes Ill pick Kermits song any day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasysomeday theyll find it the rainbow connections the lovers the dreamers and me!
The first feature length Muppet Movie and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos keeps to a simple but original plot classic Muppet lame jokes Paul Williams genius in song writing and Electric Mayhem madness and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets Only Croft has come close to Hensens genius with puppets Half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actoractress still alive???? I can only hope Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive Kermit and Company from the deadly grasp of Disney
Who doesnt love the muppets?! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside So I guess whats important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special I dont remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly In fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the magic transcends all that other stuff Tis indeed what movies are made ofbr br So how does the film achieve these things? Hmmm nice question! Stumped am I? Lets see Really I feel like its quite simple The filmmakers believe in their material and dont take themselves too seriously in the process I probably wouldnt say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack) A zest You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures They also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearingbr br Generally I get the impression that the people that made the movie just werent afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session Lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance Maybe I dont feel I have much to say about it because I was half-asleep when I saw it (andor as I write this review) Anyway Im sort of semi-repeating myself here but I really liked the sense of family the movie had Full of love I suppose you might say Again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlesslybr br And to repeat myself once more one of the films best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly so The Muppet Movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so Same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that Anyway if that sounds sappy I also reckon it was pretty hilariousbr br So all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to Plus it features lots of great music! Highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released All these years later at 37 and I had no qualms hiring it on DVD Great entertainment for all ages And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See:br br Why are there so many songs about rainbows And whats on the other side? Rainbows are visions but only illusions And rainbows have nothing to hide So weve been told and some choose to believe it I know theyre wrong wait and see Someday well find it the rainbow connection The lovers the dreamers and mebr br Who said that every wish would be heard and answered When wished on the morning star? Somebody thought of that and someone believed it And look what its done so far Whats so amazing that keeps us stargazing And what do we think we might see? Someday well find it the rainbow connection The lovers the dreamers and mebr br All of us under its spell We know that its probably magicbr br  Have you been half asleep? And have you heard voices? Ive heard them calling my name  Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors? The voice might be one and the same Ive heard it too many times to ignore it Its something that Im sposed to be Someday well find it the rainbow connection The lovers the dreamers and mebr br Laa da daa dee da daa daa La laa la la laa dee daa doo
First of all id like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind It is the best out of all the excellent Muppet movies and every other movie out there! so BOO-YA for jim Henson!br br This Movie is the first of all the Muppet movies and the best (boo ya) Its about a Frog (kermit) who tries to make to hollywood along with the awesome friends he meets on the way comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are bound to become classics including the rainbow connectionbr br in conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest thing EVER! If you havnt already seen it then get off your computer and get you tushy to your nearest video store!!! (if they dont have the muppet movie id sue them BIG TIME )

This deals with Kermit the frog going on a trip to Hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way This movie along with being already good has excellent songs performed by the Muppets including Rainbow Connection Can You Picture That? Moving Right Along and others This movie unlike the other Muppet flicks carries a strong sentimental value to me Its such a nice movie Also noted is its many cameos featuring Steve Martin Mel Brooks and a dozen othersbr br my rating-A plus 109 mins rated G
Yknow its very interesting watching this half the people involved with it are now deadbr br Anyways its been a long time since Ive watched anything Muppet related but this stuff is pure gold Im a great fan of puns and this movie has them quite well placed but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: its not really high-speed childrens pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the characters depth its just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to gobr br Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character His voice and the expressions on his puppet-face are fantastic But above all he points out why hes popular--he can sing and make jokes too!--but more appropriately why hes so endearing--he without any effort inspires everyone to search for their dreams In the meantime he also has to deal with himself which is an uncommon theme in family moviesbr br It also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there some to great effect others to a little less (I think Mel Brooks part was just a bit overplayed do you?) Some parts of the film are just kind of odd But its highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different directionbr br Moving right alongbr br --PolarisDiB
Jim Hensons The Muppet Movie is a charming funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters great story and great wit that it is irresistable The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteered and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey across America to follow his dream in Hollywood Along the way he meets Fozzie Bear The Great Gonzo (my favorite) Miss Piggy Rolf and DR Teeth and the electric mayhembr br This film has so many good things I cant even say them But it is memorable and every time I think of a puppet or muppet I will think of this film Look for cameos from Mel Brooks Dom DeLouise Paul Williams Madeline Kahn Bob Hope Richard Pryor Steve martin Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey) Elliot Gould Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles Excellent and spectacular one of the best films of the 70s A++
In many ways the perfect movie The Incredible Journey and Horatio Alger tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of existentialism In essence the travails of the muppets boil down to the finale song of the movie: Lifes like a movie write your own ending keep believing keep pretending They create their own reality which has all the trappings of every epic tale: a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily a obstacle-laden journey; an ever-increasing group of like-minded individuals for camaraderie; a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption; and a big-budget Hollywood ending because darn it all they CANbr br Only Jim Henson could pull this off He walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without swerving too long or too hard into either Of course it seems odd that invest such weight into a film starring puppets but in the end perhaps they are the perfect uh puppet to make these points The movies atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream the happy ending unnecessary cameos and bursting into song at the drop of a hat Usually these aspects are anathema to quality in film but the self-deprecating manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt-free viewing One of the few films that can truly be called suitable for all agesbr br The other muppet-related films (including The Empire Strikes Back) while palatable do not touch the simple grace of this film Take for instance the musical number Hope that Something Better Comes Along the duet of Kermit and Rowlf Amusing in its vaudevillian goofiness yet makes a bitingly crucial point about the motivations behind life choices Brilliant
MINOR SPOILERSbr br Misunderstood classic remains one of Hensons finest and most personal films It may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhls snappy screenplay and Paul Williamss knockout songs Now while these things are admittedly great as is the movies formal playfulness (screenplay-within-the-screenplay film break etc) what distinguishes The Muppet Movie from the other Muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture Its a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again Throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the Muppets have made it: Piggy abandons Kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent Gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performers life on the road in his haunting Im Going to Go Back There Someday and worst of all Kermit is continually tortured and tested by Doc Hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes (One can only wonder what Henson would have made of his familys management of the company after his death) Kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final Magic Store number questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way All this is punctuated with the expected Muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent But The Muppet Movie isnt just another jokefest as the rest of the diminishing-return Muppet films would become No its a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and its every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago 95 out of 10
This film is about aging Geisha in post war Tokyo Okin played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara lends money to two other ex Geisha Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it Tamae has a son Otomi a daughter who during the film announce theyre leaving them while Okin never a mother gets visits from two men in her past who it turns out just want money from her Its a compelling tale of what choices you make what you do to get through life and who youre responsible and beholden to Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding less than compassionate Okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her but at the same time almost envy her At a time when great films were made by Ozu Mizoguchi Kinoshita and Kurosawa amongst others Mr Naruse is right up there with him If you have a region free DVD player you should attempt to find the two Naruse box sets released in England I think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant That they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi This is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired Geishas Whatever happens when such a woman ages and loses her charm and mystique? Well for those who are interested watch this film One: Okin is successful as a money-lender but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful Okin doesnt have any children but the other do Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her and is excited Naruse is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists characters Bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness and ones life-worth Very good film indeed
A look at three geishas who are way past their prime Now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present Kin (played by Floating Weeds Haruko Sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her The other two Nobu and Tamae wish they could land husbands but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will Meanwhile their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other) Tamae is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man Nobus concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature but they are also (understandably) self-serving After her son leaves shell be alone A bit into the film two of Kins former clients come looking for her one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him the other one of her handsomest clients Unfortunately he comes for her money not her love The way Ive described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing but its really not Sad but not fatally so Its more bittersweet Unfortunately I only marginally liked Late Chrysanthemums The story seems better when I look back on it but it is very slow and dull I actually nodded off twice during the film and I wasnt at all tired before I started it This is the kind of film that I can appreciate more than like; it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of Ozus more famous films 710
Mikio Naruses examination of the lives of three idling constantly complaining single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy she is the only one of the three that has no children The other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income because neither of them work Complications ensue when the kids decide to get married (though not to each other) and leave home This leads to the bitter grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender Meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy despite her fortunes She has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her The three characters are all neck-deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or at the very most toss complaints back and forth to each otherbr br Late Chrysanthemums is very slow-moving and not much actually happens but Naruse like all great directors has the ability to do much with very little I havent seen much of his work but I suspect that this isnt his best even though it is very good The problem I think is that it all doesnt seem to amount to much But the film is full of good points Although it is cynical it isnt overly so Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self-made misery While the film isnt a must-see it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known (outside of his own country) director precious little of which is available on video here in the U S
For me Late Chrysanthemums was interesting not only because it was my first film of Naruse I completely enjoyed but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s work Ive seen This doesnt mean innovative editing in the way Godard would introduce it with Breathless in 1959 but quite the oppositebr br The editing was as fluent as in the best of Hollywood films from the 30s40s but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way he was telling his story Unlike them it never purposefully accentuated anything or tried to make itself invisible but together with the cinematography made me feel like I was traveling on a gentle stream constantly feeling the waves beneath me like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle In this sense the film was comparable to Ozus and Mizoguchis work but somehow even more subtlebr br What was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself similar to the remarkable camera-work in Dreyers Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943) which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to usbr br I feel that Naruses editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious The wonderful sets and settings shouldnt be forgotten either! I found the story itself to be rather conventionalbr br The narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way and I thought that the first half of the film was setting up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations Unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and and formulaic compared to the set up (though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other - less complex - film) Somehow I felt that he failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven Maybe he should have kept them intact This criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film especially since the procedure is again reminiscent to the way Ozu dealt with the plot in his films Unfortunately I havent yet the feeling that Naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in his films conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion The best efforts I have seen to date - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds  1955) and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds  1967) - sustained the energy he had built throughout the narrative while delivering poignant and resonant endingsbr br This is already more than most directors are able to do and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium In this regard and considering the resonance of the last two films Ive seen by him he may have already become one of my favoritesbr br The only problem I have at the moment is where Im going to see more of his films on the big screen
Sadness and nostalgia permeate Late Chrysanthemums a 1954 film by Japanese auteur Mikio Naruse now undergoing a retrospective of his long unavailable films thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi Late Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geishas now middle-aged whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret Performance are uniformly outstanding particularly that of Haruko Sugimura who starred in films by Ozus Late Spring Floating Weeds and Tokyo Story among others Sugimura portrays Kin a former Geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speakbr br She has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money particularly real estate speculation and loaning money to her friends Nobu (Sadako Sawamura) Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki) all former geishas Kins friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet Both Tomi and Tamae are in the process of losing their children Tamaes son is leaving to work in the coalmines in Hokkaido and Tomis daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man Both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitablebr br Two male friends visit Kin Seki a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide and Tabe (Ken Uehara) another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years Her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money Naruse cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as Kin confronts Tabe and Tomi and Tamae console each other over the loss of their children The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who though their future does not seem bright refuse to see themselves merely as victims Late Chrysanthemums has the simplicity humor and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of Ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way
Subtle delicate touchingbr br A young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy History of a coming -out and anatomy of relationshipbr br Soft ambiguous gestures slices of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expressionbr br Two men a girl a afternoon on beach some words and a gift Religious traces and a pantheist vision Cercle of light and expression nooks of an ordinary day and hot eveningbr br A erotic chaste film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only instruments for good definition of a universe with sensitives valuesbr br Pledge for self- discover universe of beauty exploration the sign of Ozon and same nostalgic air of every creation Robe dete is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream to look with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people
i expected it to be good after id seen some other ozons superb moments and read much about it but this movie is brilliant - clever very bright (emotionally and visionally) perfect in all moments every movement is there for a reason everything fits so closely and primordially true and honest this is the movie about the beauty and innocence; about its simplicity
Theres not a dull moment in Francois Ozons Robe dEte Its surprising how much is packed into this short film While reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach On returning to the beach they find that all his clothes have been stolen She lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day He rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl His gay companion is sexually excited Early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended She suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance Its a light-hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes
Im just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon Ive seen only 4 films so far and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12 and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundingsbr br This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for goodbr br The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozons films so it doesnt grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might) Watch for the feelings not for their objectsbr br Very nice and fleeting truly like a summer romance and while being a relaxation to thought and mind it gives some food for the soul
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind One knows its going to about a mute one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentimentbr br Well forget it The movie starts with a little black humour and then gets started From then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of Moscow All right it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder But this movie doesnt let you gobr br Its like the old gangster movies but then without any glamour at all and in Russia And thats one of the most important aspects of this movie: its situated in Russia This does have a great impact on the movie according to me it makes it better Everything becomes simple and basic life is without nonsense This could be a great potential for more movies in the future gangster movies about the Russian mafiabr br It is a beautifull and terrifying movie Its horror but you cant feel but sympathy for the little mute One last advice: dont look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well
First half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally Im not easy to scare but second half of this thriller didnt work quite a well but still very scary! A good thriller than use simple ways to make good horror Lowbudget set in Russia unknown cast and made in Europe but still great fun and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well!
If you want to see a true thriller rent this!!! Its not from the director or screenwriter of Scream doesnt feature overacting overpaid TV actors passing off as stars and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza Instead youll get a top-notch edgy very strong (in violence) yet thrilling nailbiter
Well this film came on on a workday at 230am The cute little actress who played Billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes I was held captive to my television till the very end It has you on the edge of your seat then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequencesbr br The only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film causing certain sequences to drag just a little Nonetheless it was still very entertaining and I recommended it to all my co-workers the next day
Mute Witness is a modest yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves The film  written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller  is a tense action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery Mute Witness handles about the vicious topic of snuff-movies and is effectively set in Russia  SPOILERS  Since the production costs are cheaper there a US film crew temporarily moves to Russia for shooting a horror film An old hangar is used as film location The female make-up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff-movie! Shes caught and tries to escape but since shes a mute she cant cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly The girls life is in real danger now since theres a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they dont want the witnesses to be alive  End Spoilers  Mute Witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody Some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end Regarding the similar topic Id say its definitely better than the more famous 8 mm directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage The acting in Mute Witness isnt great but the leading actress (whos Russian herself) looks really cute Sir Alec Guinness makes a special appearance too And a very cool one I may say Surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares
This is a VERY good movie I give it a 10br br Its very different in that its kind of a long stalking scene all the way through The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable waybr br She sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time) I wont reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience but rest assured: its very believable well played very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great endingbr br Dont miss this movie
Superbly crafted low-budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as wellbr br The cast play it very well although Richards self-centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times The tiny two-scene cameo by Sir Alec Guinness oozing menace as the crime czar of Moscow is simply the icing on the cakebr br Well worth repeated viewing but not on dark nights when youre all alone!
An intense thriller about a mute movie make-up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night After she tries to get away from the murder scene she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness This movie leaves you on the edge of your seat
This is definitely one of the most scary and spell-binding films ever made You are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end Even though there are some plot holes it keeps being exciting to the final showdown Besides 8 MM and Peeping Tom this is one of the best films about Snuff Movies a taboo theme of our culture If you like the SCREAM Trilogy you will probably love that one
I love this movie ! I think Ive seen it 5 times already (it was quite a success in France and they often play it on TV) Ok its a thriller and there is great tension But mostly (and specifically in the second part) it is absolutely hilarious ! And very original The directing and photography are just splendid
Ive waited 9 years to watch this film simply because i never saw it advertised on TV Eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait Its much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because its all at a fairly quick pace with no drawn out creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes Only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but dont let that put you off in any way What lies beneath - over hyped and crap Mute witness - low budget not hyped at all and very good
The plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well There is a plenty of comic relief too Some things do not make a lot of sense (eg the first chase scene why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?) The Russians actually speak Russian without accent but the cars are extremely strange with models spanning like 50 years and so the place seems weirdly out of time Overall if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well
I enjoyed the acting in this movie Except for the sister She reminded me of Janice on Friends I could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious br br My main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law The guy falling out of the exploding car? Maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital maybe then I could have gone for the ending I think somebody needed to die in the execution scene Mainly the brother-in-law He was such a pain in the ass anyway Or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute I could have even bought into the brother-in-law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films br br It is worth watching again and as I always say it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author
This is without doubt one of my favourite horror films ever! I really cannot believe that it didnt gain much more popularity when it was released especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual Wes Craven sequels and copycat horrors Mute Witness has all the style suspense and quickfire plot twists of a HitchcockDePalma movie coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot It never promises to be any more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it isbr br The plot centres on Billie Hughes - a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a Russian factory By a series of events she finds herself accidentally locked in and stumbles on the filming of a snuff moviebr br One of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made As the main character is mute she cannot make a noise - something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie and a curse in othersbr br The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well Even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek nod to both Hitchcocks Psycho as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenesbr br While the acting can be hammy at times the whole film does hold it together not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to endbr br All in all a hugely overlooked well-paced and action packed psycho-thriller which I would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual FreddyJasonScreamMichael MyersDamien regurgitations at halloween
One of my all-time favourite movies Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia I would so I could enjoy this movie as much as I did that very first time Its still enjoyable second and third times round but I found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills werent unexpected If you want a see a film that you truly wont be able to predict the ending of then I highly recommend this film Its chilling shocking full of suspense and theres also loads of humour to help you through it too If you watch this film and dont love it I truly question your sanity!
I dont know how this film went unnoticed for so longbr br I saw this film on TV i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film i missed the first probably  10 minutes but that does not matterthis film literally gripped me it is a real spine chillerbr br The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effectu do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to so it is all the more tenseEven though there are many new faces their performances were top classbr br The filmmakers play with your mind just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest The shock fear horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the filmbr br The well written situations n twistsfast camera movements slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller This film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock br br I could not even move from the TV even during the commercial breaks  i was the helpless MUTE WITNESS to this superb film
Man I never laugh so much this year and its pretty hard to make me laugh While I expected some Hostel-style movie the smile came to my face even from the beginning This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed victim messing the whole set until she finally die Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us the viewers that Mute Witness is not a typically horror moviebr br The main character the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina Her performance is top-notch; her character cant speak so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensateAnd oh boy she did a wonderful job Her sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or the fiancée or the wife of the in-film director (Evan Richards) They were both very funny most of the time I wont spoil more but the scenes following the bathtub moment with them two the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedybr br The plot get twisted near the end possibly misleading at one particular moment But dont worry Such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-girl-friend
In todays world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it Movies like Psycho and Blair Witch while being great in suspense (both with great build ups) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them With Mute Witness a rare treat I stumbled upon this film and watched it scared witless in the middle of the night I was scared by the menacing Russian ambience the snuff theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the (amusing which always leads to likeable) characters could meet the end at any second Since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations It also has Fay Ripley in a rare movie role watch and prepare to be excited scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways
I couldnt stop watching this movie though it was far past my bedtime br br Comparisons to Hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you It walks a wonderful line between real immediate suspense and a dark distancing humor Like many of Hitchs heroes our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardybr br The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out Right from the opening shots they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication; who is to be trusted and who is a monster The plot twists and turns unpredictably Suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork imagery music -- but most simply THE EYES of the characters which sends raw fear right into you br br A warning: there is some frighteningly real gore as well as some nudity The horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage-slasher picbr br And a teen-slasher pic it AINT The characters are quirky and feel like real people for one thing -- a couple (including the heroine) you may even find endearing as I did There will be no mistake youre watching a movie made for grown-ups I mean Alec Guinness is in it briefly and you know he didnt NEED the work!br br Pop this in the VCR some night when you cant sleep   and dont want to yet
The story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie Then the story gets more and more outrageous The Main character portrayed by Marina Sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role This could have been a super-great movie had the ending been more realistic
It is always a well-known and important directorial device to set up the atmosphere of a film within the first 5 minutes In the crucial opening scenes the film should assert itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film Here in Mute Witness we find a prime example of thisbr br Scene spoiler br br In the first 5-10 minutes the film opens to a very Hitchcockian scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment with the radio on Shes wandering around applying lipstick dolling herself up and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose Of course the serial killer is in her house and monitoring her moves knife in hand She hears a noise looks in a room and there is her partner in a pool of blood At the very point of her screams she turns around to be faced with the knife-wielding maniac who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying actbr br then something odd happens As the woman convulses in her death throes the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim perish Before he finds his lighter his cigarette is litfrom someone else in the room! The camera pans out and we realise that there are more and more people in the room some taking notes some filming some recording the death and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die and making a very hammy job of it too When the audience realises whats going on and the whole scene is part of a film the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humourbr br End Scene Spoiler br br I have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons Firstly it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma with some very disorientating and even blackly humorous moments - It conveys a central subject matter (that of the difference between a movie screen death and a snuff film death an issue which is elaborated on later in the film) and finally it introduces the viewer to the characters all as silently as possiblebr br The plot of Mute Witness centres around Billy Hughes an American special effects make-up artist who is working on the set of the film being shot in a large warehouse in Moscow Billy cannot speak but she communicates in sign language through her sister After the end of an evenings filming Billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident and in her attempt to escape is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film but turns out to be a snuff movie Suddenly her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and deathbr br Without doubt the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping Billys saving grace and her handicap is the fact that she isnt able to utter a sound (In fact in my opinion one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isnt chock-full of women screaming) There are some utterly disturbing moments and some superb set-pieces of real suspense (The corridoor and the elevator shaft are perfect examples) The timing is fluid and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itselfbr br The second half of the film introduces new concepts While there are still several suspenseful moments the focus is on plot twists New characters are introduced and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on While there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film it just doesnt quite measure up to the first half There are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes but there are also some very lame comedy moments (coming specifically from Billys sister and her fiancée who happens to be the director of the movie Billy is working on) that almost ruin the film just because they are badly misplaced andor mistimed and ruin the pace - At the end the twists keep coming at a rapid-fire speed and the climax of the film is appropriately as tense as the first halfbr br There are several things that really make the movie work The barriers of communication that Billy must face both as a mute and as an American in Moscow mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation The actress that plays Billy Natasha Zudina does a wonderful job in the film with an engaging on-screen prescence and a brilliant performance and finally the direction as a whole but most particularly in the first half of the film which truly is a study in Alfred Hitchcocks suspensethriller film techniquesbr br As I have already said though the let-downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added There is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (The sister and the moviemaker) to turn their scenes into some unusual sit-com However despite these shortcomings the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller and ideal for a group viewing at halloween (Certainly better than the usual slasher horror film!)
If you enjoy suspense this movie has it The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense Alec Guinesss appearance was nice but didnt really add to the movie Im not sure if Evan Richards part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot I thought the cinematography was excellent This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful Also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to Andy Clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done I would call it overall good entertainment
I went into this film expecting a slasher and while Mute Witness does take influence from said style of film-making this is much more than just your average slash flick There are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability - blindness is more common (Blind Terror Wait Until Dark Cat oNine Tails to name a handful) but the implications of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character cant speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of Our mute witness is Billy Hughes a make-up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in Moscow She finds herself locked in after hours one night and after attempting to phone her sister for help she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an illicit sex flick but soon turns out to be a snuff movie! She tries to convince the authorities of what shes seen but finds that no one believes her storybr br Recently Hostel made the headlines for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country but this film did it first and actually does a better job Its maybe not quite as nasty as Eli Roths opus but the gore is more effective and since director Anthony Waller (who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with The Guilty) implements a good sense of humour into the proceedings Mute Witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to watch The director certainly has a talent for crafting suspenseful thrill rides as this one never stands still The plot is put into action quickly and Waller constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film The acting isnt bad for a B-movie with young performers Marina Zudina Fay Ripley and Evan Richards delivering good performances The atmosphere is gritty and the Russian locations are suitably unfriendly which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere Overall Mute Witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be The plot flows well and the atmosphere and tension are spot on
Billy Hughes is a mute young lady working for make-up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in Moscow by an American director One night Billy gets locked in the movie studio Later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out Thats when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered while being filmed After escaping the clutches of the murderers Billy informs the authorities only to be red-faced when the men show it was an act Billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importancebr br I dont know how this heart-pounding sleeper passed me by but I thought it was a much older flick Theres one thing though its got to be one of the most jarringly and intense thrillers Ive seen in quite a while Its just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place! The first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation Underling this is a humorously wicked black streak Faults do pop up in the story as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour (or better putter comic relief) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richards characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful In the long run it probably could have done without Despite some cringe moments this aspect didnt hinder my enjoyment of it For me the soft ending they decided to go with just didnt feel rightbr br The interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods So multi-facet was the context and its thrills there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the nervy jolts and unbearable tension are weaved into a range of sudden plot turns and twists Really they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke English and so we are caught up in the confusion too The delicate Marina Zudina gives a harrowing portrayal of the American mute girl Billy The way she able to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability Director Anthony Waller shoots the flick in a rather stylish well-timed and skillful manner without loosing that grimy look that eventuates from its rigid surroundings and a powerfully airy music score persistently nags at you The only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by Alec Guinness The performances by the cast were all fine especially the nail biting turns by Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as the Russian murderersbr br This riveting feature thats mostly made up of unknowns is way better than your average dark thriller Highly Recommended
A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasherhorror genre with savvy self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensionsbr br This movie was MUTE WITNESS Starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie) it told the story of a mute make-up artist Billie who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sisters boyfriend Andy She is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody Overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence a chase ensues and finally she is rescued by Andy who take her home as they alert the police The trouble is there is no body no evidence that anything of the sort took place Even so a mysterious inspector seems to be on Billies side of the storybr br And to say more would be criminal MUTE WITNESS is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller its one that pays its dues to movies like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts deadpan humor Americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless and nail-biting suspense until it seems something must snap Even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots (for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away Very smart
An amazing piece of film that was well-conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat Brilliantly orchestrated in its timing and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release The acting was generally well-done (the Director shouldve asked Alec Guinness for acting lessons) and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as Billy tries to race to the door in the studio) This movie didnt let up since the opening scene
This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seenbr br In fact its so nerve-wracking I havent been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago but I will since I have the DVD There were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watchso if youve got problems and need to escape for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else br br The Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone which she had to do since her character in here is a mute She plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker After the days shooting is done and Billie is about to leave she hears something She takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a snuff film and actually killing someone Billies eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse-type buildingbr br There are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out The first I described above The second scene the climactic one goes on too long and isnt as well done as the first In fact the film should have been trimmed a bit but overall since its so good at keeping our attention then it served its purpose as entertainment
I just finished this movie and my only comment is OH! WOW! Jennifer Beals is ok as the fiancee but Yancy Butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite! Having watched her in WITCHBLADE I was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screenbr br I gotta see THIS movie againif only for Yancy Butler as Corrinne!
I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for Eleanor Bergstein The primary actors (Campbell Scott Jennifer Beals Yancy Butler James Goodwin III Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well selected and played their parts with excellence It was a very uplifting movie that I wish was available on tape or DVD A rare gem
Love this little film that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem SHALL WE DANCE? (not the overblown GereJlo remake) Luckily I found it and taped it when it was showing on a STARZ Promo Weekend because as far as I know its not available on DVD Ill watch just about anything with Yancy Butler (anyone remember the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) in it and she positively shines in this She does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT!! Loved all the other characters in it especially the ones played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (wheres she been all these years?) This is one of those films that I take out from time to time and always come away smiling after watching it Recommended highly!!!
Meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970s this movie plays more like something Mr Schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway A mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in Florida and along the freeway of life the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor The problem is that what DIDNT end up on the cutting room floor probably should have! Now available on DVD its kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost $100 million to produce had it been made in 2004 It rolls along and isnt too difficult to sit through and strangely enough in 2004 were all still pretty much justbr br hopping in our cars and going faster and faster heading nowhere
I found this movie on Netflix and had to add it to my queue I wasnt disappointed when I got it as its just as funny now as when I saw it at a local drive-in theater back thenbr br It builds to a climax nicely with you getting glimpses of the various characters as they begin their trip across America on the Honky Tonk Freeway America on wheels This was a strange comedic role for William DeVane as I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 TV film The Missiles of October and felt no one could have pulled that dramatic character off as well as he didbr br It reminds me a bit of Dick Van Dyke in Cold Turkey where Van Dyke played the local minister DeVanes role as mayor minister and activist was typical for small towns so it makes his character seem amusing and realbr br Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as the spoiled family in the RV was on target for the time as well Anyone who has traveled across country with small children (Are we there yet?) will appreciate those scenesbr br The scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town I grew up in but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns Its sad that many small towns disappeared because of the freeway system and it gives a realistic if humorous view of what they had to do to survive (Used zoo animals anyone?)br br All in all its a lightweight comedy with no particular message but a humorous glance at America during the early 80s Well worth watching if you just need a bit of good cheer
Back in August 81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies big hits like Urban Cowboy Every Which Way But Loose Smokey and the Bandit were all the rage For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose Honky Tonk Freeway as the title hoping it would help the movies box office receipts by drawing in that same Urban Cowboy crowd Instead Honky Tonk Freeway bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title Thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of its time No matter what probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy itbr br Its too bad this movie bombed But I think it would have anyway even if it hadnt been saddled with a poor title Its a movie ahead of its time One could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or great-uncle anyway) to the kinds of comedy made today For its day Honky Tonk Freeway was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didnt get popular in comedy till much later on While clearly its a child of Airplane its more mature and while its certainly no Knocked Up it clearly points in that direction The characters are more comedy-mature in that they are low-key and dont ever think anything they do is anything other than serious The jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situationsbr br But more than that Honky Tonk Freeway is a real time capsule A great look back at the exceedingly early 80s The people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did It was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around thembr br I dont know if my review is helping you but this is really a good sometimes kind of excellent movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger Beverly DAngelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr Terry Garr was just about to become the toast of Hollywood as her next movie after this one was Tootsie which finally made her a star Howard Hessmann was arguably the biggest current star of the the day when this movie was made Back in 1981 Howard Hessmann was the star of the big hit TV show WKRP in Cinncinatti He played its lead character the rascally night DJ Daniel Stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown-up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80s sitcom The Wonder Years There are also several faces that are no longer with us these days its nice to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as a an old married couple on a journey Jessica Tandy would finally pick up her Oscar ten years after this for Driving Miss Daisy There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of her final movie appearances Though shed had a brilliant career she didnt get her Oscar till four years after this in 1985s Trip to Bountiful for which she richly deserved it and she died very soon after getting that awardbr br Plus there are lots of other faces in this movie actors who arent big stars but who have done tons of supporting work Many are familiar even if you cant think of their namebr br This movie is a pleasant little diversion A bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all in a vaguely Altman-esk way end up heading towards Florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of Ticlaw Florida which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to Ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the mapbr br And thats also what this movie is about fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system which had only recently been completed It had taken a generation to build from when it was authorized by congress around 1960 through many years as different parts were built and then went live and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is And people were enchanted by it Everybody by 1980 was pretty much an interstate freeway veteran in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs only on and off ramps and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible By 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom And this was all new then br br The ending is anti-climatic and isnt that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment What makes it great is its the journey not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day Forget its title; instead let it take you down memory lane
A wonderful film ahead of its timebr br I think so In the eightys it was all about winning Greed is Good ? Remember that one ? I have seen this film more that 20 times To me this is a real desert island film I keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that I just love Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin are simply wonderfulAlso Beverly Dangelo Beau Bridges come in at a close second dont get me wrong there are many more great performances in this film and it is also the way it is written that made it for me and I hope you a film that you will want to see over and over I think TV shows like Northen Exposure and now Earl owe a lot to this film but remember it is not a Tom Cruise film
I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid I loved it Whilst I havent watched it recently I am sure I would enjoy it just the same today Its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh The situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mothers ashes (who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion)  the robbers and the nuns This nice humour style is much missed these days Also this movie proved that actor Paul Keenan (DynastyDays of our Lives) was off to a great start I recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video shop
A notorious big budget flop when released This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast Although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end If you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names but you know their faces) heck even the kid from A Christmas Story turns up in a small part Rent if from Netflix if you read this I bet you will enjoy it
In the early 80s I recorded Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable Since then I have waited hoping it would be on DVD Yesterday I found it It is one of the best humorous character studies I ever saw The Old Fashioned episode is priceless At this time (42802) only two have reviewed it One hated it the other loved it If you have a DVD player either rent it or buy it as I did
VERY memorable comedy Its fun to watch the many situations develop and finally converge after a long journey on that greatest collection of eclectic humanity (and the worlds largest honky-tonk) - the great American Freeway Like mad mad world its got loads of contemporary talent old-boy politics good comedic action and dialog Unlike that one it is the target that seeks not the unwitting seekers - they have no idea what they really want as they drift along Americas great road Nor does it carry the weight of having a great fall guy who is saved only in the end by a great belly-laugh But the ending stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent film editing humor and timing and the big city bank scene is hilarious with very original acting by one very talented character in particular The total aplomb of the city dwellers in the face of chaos leaves one feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling The slapstick is funny but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuance and character reactions that are easily missed All in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are good or bad and the goofy situations we find ourselves in It was just meant to be FUNNY and it is!
This movie bombed at the box office and in the voting here but I loved it One measure of a movies worth is how much of it you can still remember after 25 years I wont bore you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes also a good story and great casting The inept robbers are a hoot See it and judge if it ever gets on TCM
This is an interesting hard to find movie from the early 70s starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesnt make the cut as a marine Dressed in baby blue outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home the failed recruits are sent packing Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine Raider Geres character is already jaded and contemplating desertion and he takes advantage of Vincents innocence stealing his baby blue uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway Vincents character whose name is Marion takes Geres outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine Raider Marion hitch-hikes his way into Wyoming and stops at a little Norman Rockwell-like little town In the local café he meets Rose Hudkins who immediately catches his eye Staying with Hudkins parents Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine Raider could still be so innocent The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps as the towns folks go hunting 3 escapees Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt But theres still a happy ending which befuddled me a bit I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway this captures JMV at the peak of his 70s performances BUSTER AND BILLIE BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70s were amazingly good JMV performances He was both an action star and a heart-throb all at the same time!!! He made a lot of quality movies during his career and continued to do so up into the mid 80s with the great TV show Airwolf He does a very good job in this as Hedge quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country He must have performed some of the stunt work as well- there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie-and it looks like hes the guy getting tossed down the river to me! But really at the height of his popularity this movie could have done so much more with JMVs talent and his looks Innocence can only be so interesting Evil as explored in Buster and Billie is much more dramatic! Anyway Glynnis OConnor is delightful as Rose The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting The outdoor scenes are gorgeous - must have been filmed in Canada
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time The opening narrative music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me You either love the movie or hate it Jan Michael Vincent was at his all time best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way This movie is at the top of my all time favorites a shame it isnt available on DVD or VHS anymore The ending was also wonderful John Hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time
SPOILERS Beautifully photographed slice of life home-front WWII love story with Norman Rockwell paintings in the beginning and end of the movie about how a war hero is not just someone who kills for his country but is also someone who thinks for himself and isnt corrupted by the war propaganda thats constantly drummed into his head Washing out of the Marine Corps Marion Hedg Hedgepeth Jan Michael-Vincentis kicked out of boot-camp after five weeks and forced to put on a Baby Blue Marine uniform that shows that he just didnt have it to make the Corps Humilitated and scorned wherever he went as hes going home to St Louis and terrified what his family whom his dad was in the Marine Corps in WWI would think of him in that he couldnt Cut the Mustard as a US Marine br br Hedg stopping in a bar and finds sitting next to him is a Marine member of the fearless and deadly Marine Raiders Richard Gere whom a admiring Hedge buys a beer Making conversation with Richard Hedge is shocked to find out that not only is he being sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles he fought in and combat medals he got but the totally gray hair and mid-thirty looking Richard is going to be 21 next month! Thats what being in the Marine Corps and WWII did to him! Buying Hedge a number of drinks Richard takes the drunk Baby Blue outside and knocks him out taking his Baby Blues and leaves his impressive US Marine uniform with some money in it for Hedge to ware br br As soon as Hedge puts on Richards uniform that fits him perfectly hes confronted by this big drunken US paratrooper who calls himself Cement-Head wanting to have a fist fight with the Marine Raider Hedge doing everything he can to avoid trouble is forced by Cement-Head to belt him after he himself cracked two beer bottle over his cement-head to get himself warmed up for the big bout between MarineHedge and Paratrooper Cement-Head Hedge incredibly floors the big cement headed buffoon knocking him out cold with one punch! I guess the trick is not hitting him in on top of his head a stunned Hedge tell his Cement-Heads fellow GIsbr br Hitch-hiking to this small town of Bidwell Hedge notices this US Military internment camp for Japanese-Americans who are there because their considered a threat to US security Its later in the movie that Hedge shows everyone what a real hero he is not who the people in the town think he is by risking his life to save one of the hated Japs who mindlessly together with two of his friends escaped from the interment camp where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving the scared to death Japanese-American from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the town Hedge in his actions taught the people of Bidwell that not all Japs even those who are American citizens are bad and treacherous banzai screaming suicidal kamikazes like they were thought by the newspapers magazines and movies at the time to think that they werebr br Hedge strikes up a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local diner Rose Hudkins Glynnis OConnorwhos just crazy about him that even Hedge at first thinks that its his uniform not him that impressed her Later when Hedge admits to Rose that hes not what she and her parents thinkA US Marine Raiderthat he is Rose had by then gotten to know the sweet and caring washed-out marine so well that it didnt matter to her at all what he was supposed to be a Marine a Paratrooper or a Post Office worker it was what was inside his heart that really countedbr br The film has a number of touching and beautiful scenes in it between Hedge and Rose that shows how movies used to be made years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in movies today that involved two people in love with each otherbr br The way the film accurately not phony baloney shows the true feelings of average Americans back then in 1943 about the war in general and Japanese in particular couldnt have been done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste Baby Blur Marine does its best not to be too politically correct in not showing the heros or leading actors and actresses in the film having the same feelings and ideas back then during WWII as most people have now which would have come across as phony as a three dollar bill to those people watching the film who lived during those historic and momentous times when the film was to take place
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River near Shasta when this movie was being filmed My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when they filmed Vincent floating down the river A little triviathe scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started his float down the river And if the stunt man missed the netting there was 20 foot waterfall about 14 mile down fartherbr br AnywayI watched it at the time and didnt get it It wasnt until years later when I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it Its pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by Jan at such a young age His movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on TV I wish this movie was available cause I would love to see it again
Just saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years I still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever The innocence and purity of a time now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film The acting is above average and Richard Geres brief appearance as a shell-shocked Raider Marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or Gere fan Jan-Micheal Vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the All-American boy The late Bruno Kirby (who was billed as BKirby Jr) has a meaty role as Pop a peace-loving Marine Corp reject dreaming of getting back home to his wife If youre looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you If youre looking for action and adventure the same applies However if you want to recapture a time in America of innocence honor romance and love then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you
Cheezy? Yep Poorly filmed? You betcha Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters Brilliant anyway (or because of it)? For surebr br This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! br br This is not an all-out spoof like Scary Movie but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun silly sexy and goofy good time!
OK so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted right? Right! Consider yourselves officially warned and read onbr br In this parodytribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980s - a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious Murder McGee who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard As Im sure you can guess things go from bad to worse faster than you can say Wheres the beef?? and in typical 80s horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody the dialogue is cheesy and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get Good timesbr br No clique or 80s horror movie clichéd characterizations are left unrepresented here In fact no stone was left unturned at all  we have the cool hero his innocent girlfriend the Goth chick the tough thug (think John Bender) the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt a couple of gorgeous half-naked lesbians and two big geeksbr br As you can plainly see the cast is pretty big Usually larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel Not in this case though Not a single cast member left me disappointed The acting was very well done Everyone from the cool hero in his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to the grooovy Goth chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett  they all played it straight brought their A-game and knocked it out of the park If youre a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science youll immediately fall in love with the geeksbr br Directorco-writer Jeff C Smith is a guy to watch for in the future trust me on this If this is what he can do with a low budget there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects The characters were dead on; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughs were huge; the blood flowed and squirted and sprayed beautifully  it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980s Call this one THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets NIGHT OF THE DEMONS!!! The tag line says it all and says it honestly - EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE; GRATUITOUS NUDITY; ZERO BUDGET - no false advertising here folks! As fans of this genre we have to look to the indies and support these hard-working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered-down PG-13 horror or pointless remakes like The Hitcher No thank you - no more of that for mebr br In closing I honestly have to say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best indie flicks Ive gotten the pleasure of watching this year Its a bloody good time and holds up on repeat viewings From the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobeeven the closing love theme over the end credits (which if that doesnt bring back fits of laughter recalling mid-80s power ballads by REO Speedwagon - over-pronounced Rs on every word starting with the letter R - then Ill eat my DVD right now)bottom line is if youre a fan of 80s horror or horror in general no more hesitation - this flick deserves to be in your collection!!
Loved this movie! Kicking it old school! Love the idea Love the script Love the characters I really really really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored This was right up with my favs such as Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium If you are a big fan of scary AND silly then this is your movie! Only taken off one star because I would love to have had better sound Not bad sound but would have liked to have more Great blood splatters Great murder weapons Great costumes! I really love the nod to the great 80s teenager stereotype ala breakfast club And I can appreciate the non-CGI suspense Really good camera action and light suspense instead of cutting to CGI I would rather have good fake that really fake fakebr br Kisses to the cast and makers! oh loved the making-of too!
STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films Ive seen in quite some time Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80s horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves the cheesiness preposterous situations wacky and stereotypical characters of 80s horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the pastbr br STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some It has all the excessive violence and gratuitous nudity that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80s horror movies we all love I had a blast watching STMD! From the 80s outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone I just couldnt get enough!
Its the 1980s and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an Ouija board the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one Sound familiar? Its supposed to Its clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80s slashers with the tagline: Excessive violence Gratuitous nudity Zero budget br br Cant get enough; Its pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror clichés but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time There is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80s slasher films though: good acting The entire cast was very talented and you dont see that very much in any low budget flicks recent or otherwise There was a lot of chemistry between the characters I was very entertained throughout the entire film and I am fully convinced the writerdirector and cast will go a long way in their separate careers The script was very well written and the dialogue flowed naturallybr br The effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically NO BUDGET I already know this going in This film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy Although this is not an Oscar award winning opus it never claims to be and props to that Its a lot of fun If you like slashers youll really appreciate this film If you like blood and boobies youll appreciate it also
This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible  Sarahs law  following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne  In fact its scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out hed been fooled by the shows maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-sensebr br If truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud  The edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims  Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile  Cue the childs frightened screams  Like I said very poor taste br br Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs (  No one knows this but its a scientific fact  ) Labour MP Barbara Follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim  Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old Colonel   Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if theyre classed as obscene  The photos included Barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head  a dogs body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to John Holmes  Hey I never said this show was tasteful did I ? br br Its impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians  childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject  The show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but its a biting satire  Perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of Britain before they criticise a mere TV show for exacerbating tensions 
Who ever put that review as of bad taste is not all quite there its so funny genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the seriesall is as good as Morris standards if you think that it is awful distasteful or sick then i can only think of one thing to say to you: go to hell thanks it had to be said! i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete jokei would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that: havent you got anything better to do with your time? what are you trying to prove? thanks for reading my heart-filled review on the mattercheers
Chris Morris Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints both from the audience and from the people taking part But nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this The 2001 Brass Eye Special Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever airedbr br The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program! The subject that the program handled turned many heads but the message was widely misinterpreted The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program This was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia The show was purely about the media and its presentation of the subject Morris is and always will be a media satirist The notion that the program makes fun of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! Morris never attempts to do either such thing He merely draws our attention to the overwhelming and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subjectbr br Using many of his established Brass Eye characters such as Ted Maul and others Morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up and the result is as funny if not funnier than anything Morris has done previously Using his tried and tested formula Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary In actuality they are made to look like exactly what they are Retardsbr br All in all the Brass Eye Special needs to be seen to be believed And with one opening line Morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001: Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!
the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such taboo subjects such as paedophilia the newsdesk set the suits the smug presenters the men-at-the-scene shouting about things you can see behind them the pointless cgi graphs and stats the whole thing was a satire a very very funny satire the way c-list celebritys will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them itll be good for their career (there is no evidence for it but it is scientific fact) It may be hard to watch (with milly dowler and the cambridgeshire girls as well as 911) but satire is supposed to be challenging and we shouldnt be afraid to stand up against the blatant scaremongering and headline grabbing media just because its a delicate matter How this show failed to win any TV awards for its intelligence observation courage acting and thought provocation is shameful but as watching it will show you not in the least bit surprising
Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in Beware My Lovely a 1952 film from RKO Lupino and Ryan did three films together and worked well as a team both being consummate professionals and strong performers In this film based on a Broadway play called The Man Lupino is a World War I widow who rents out a room in her home Shes very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years shes not ready to move on The man who rents her room goes on vacation and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her with some heavy-duty cleaning in the house Hes friendly enough to start but later terrorizes her locking her in the house and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door as he grows violent and more out of touch with realitybr br The character played by Ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house hes working in It isnt clear whether or not hes the killer since he seems surprised to see the body He might be a split personality as when his personality turns ugly toward Lupino he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it He doesnt know that he has the keys to Lupinos house in his pocket and doesnt know why he has tickets to a party that he bought from young children who came to the doorbr br Beware My Lovely is a very suspenseful film and the two leads give terrific performances The tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way youre not expecting
Beware My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to record it and was pleased I didbr br A man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he dont get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widows house but she does not know what she is taking on here It turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer He starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar He then cuts the phones line so she cant get help from the outside A young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isnt quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off Eventually the man leaves acting as if nothing has happenedbr br I can see why Beware My Lovely was given an X certificate when released in the cinemas Some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time I also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy toobr br The cast features an excellent performance from Robert Ryan as the psychopath Ida Lupino as the widow and are joined by Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock as the boybr br This is certainly Robert Ryans most chilling performance Ive seen A must seebr br Rating: 4 stars out of 5
A terrific B-feature A virtual two-hander and set over the course of a day (you can see its stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play) and although only 77 minutes long played out in sequences akin to something like real time Robert Ryan is the psychopath who keeps Ida Lupino trapped in her own home Both are superb especially the under-rated Lupino whose initial independence and self-control soon crumble before Ryans unhinged intruder Today of course it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director Harry Horner (much better known as an Art Director) only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of Hitchcock
I particularly enjoyed Dellys review of this film and agree that Howard is not the only damaged character Howard is rather ruthlessly set-up by the script but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or if she is that he murdered her Howard doesnt know and neither do we In terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there he bolts However he never actually harms Helen Gordon no matter how enraged he is Indeed he reacts with horror at Helens fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissorsthen he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered Helen with the almost pathetic  Im very tired now I think Ill go home Frankly I dont think hes a psychopath A sick puppy certainly but not a psychopathbr br The problem with Howard is that he has no real male identity He wanted to serve his country but his mental condition denies him a place in the army He is singularly rootless and isolated: no wife no girl no home (again at least as far as we know) And he does a womans job - Floors are my speciality Helens niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job Also although he finds himself strongly attracted to Helen he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass He is remarkably powerless - cant fight cant work cant make lovebr br Helen is justifiably terrified however She tries to connect to him but finding that he doesnt respond normally (ie way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose-tinted memories of husband Ned) unwittingly presses all Howards buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escapebr br Both characters trapped in the house trapped by fear neuroses rage and memory deserve sympathy I know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers but I felt it fitted well as it offered a kind of release to the characters Helen is freed I think from the past When Howard tries on her husbands army coat Helens disgusted reaction is highlighted She no doubt feels that the sacredness of Neds possessions has been violated but hopefully her need to keep everything untouched has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger Perhaps she can move onbr br Howard is also freed - from his endless cycle of anger hurt and violence Whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable but I hope its the formerbr br Great performances from Ryan and Lupino I prefer On Dangerous Ground but this is pretty good too
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman She is a war widowbr br The set is limited but the acting makes up for this Robert Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice then confused about where he lives At first Lupino tries to help him He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous But how do we know? The suspense builds I truly enjoy films like this which rely on the human element for suspense What is this man capable of? There are some scenes with OZ Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong We keep thinking she will be helped then Ryans personality turns again He becomes like a JekyllHyde character and eventually chases Lupino with a knifebr br Worth watching for these two superb actors 910
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase He also did a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a couple of years earlier The play Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season It was Dinellis only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone br br The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference Dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so Im wondering what he thought about that Certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the storybr br That wasnt the only thing that was eliminated The people are all wearing period clothing from around World War I yet theres no reference at all to the time this story takes place in I thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to Ida Lupinos residence I noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same erabr br The film is almost entirely set within Ida Lupinos home where shes hired an itinerant stranger in Robert Ryan as a handyman The film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino in her home for about a daybr br Both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made Films like Beware My Lovely are the stuff that a small studio like RKO did best If this were done at MGM or Paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story
We are in a small town a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic and now she is unable to escape her housebr br Beware My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinellis {The Spiral Staircase} story and play called The Man Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness One however shouldnt be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture because it isnt Its clear from the get go that Ryans Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man but this is a different sort of peril movie One that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonistbr br Ryan and Lupino are a great combination they had also done the excellent and far better On Dangerous Ground this same year So with both actors clearly comfortable together it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house re: prison Ryan is particularly strong as his character flits in and out of madness with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy The direction from Harry Horner is safe {he in truth doesnt have to do much other than let his actors run with it} and George E Diskants cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches With one involving Christmas tree baubles immensely memorable Falling some where in between being average and great Beware My Lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow Film-Noir For fans of Robert Ryan tho its something of an essential viewing oh yes and then some 710
When I first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though I saw it again recently I have not changed my mind about it I think it was Robert Ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt (My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and I was impressed
The movie with its single set minimal cast and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TVs early years Nonetheless the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan He wasnt very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful But no one was better at wounded idealism (On Dangerous Ground) or the psychic pain of this movie Few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figurebr br Lupinos problem is that shes locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next The suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape Its a nail-biter all the way This is not one of Lupinos many fine soulful parts that she was so good at Instead its a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough My favorite scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting Ryans already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him Then when Whiting walks in and finds the attractive-looking Ryan scrubbing the floor she starts getting coy flirting with her budding sexuality Sensing trouble Ryan abruptly fends her off-- finesse is not his strong suit Insulted Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work womens work That does it Up to that point hes been courteous and professional with Lupino trying to set himself on a normal path But Whiting has hit his raw nerve Now theres heck to pay as Whiting bounces out the door leaving Lupino to pay the price Its a riveting scene expertly donebr br Anyway this is one of the dozen or so films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black-and-whites in favor of wide-screen spectacles Too bad What a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front She deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much
Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30s40s and 50s you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white Ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures In this film as Mrs Helen GordonHigh Sierra41 along with Robert Ryan(Howard Wilton)Golden Gloves40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor Mrs Gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection If you liked Ida Lupino who could play the roles as a criminal in a womans prison and prison warden who was hated this is the film for you to enjoy I truly believe that Ida Lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the Movie Industry!!!
I can see that the ratings for this film arent all that high for this film so I must be in the minority for liking this film so much Well I am right and everyone else is wrong (just kidding) I guess I like it because I am a psychology teacher and I really liked the brooding character played by Ryan While he truly is dangerous as well as VERY menacing you cant exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma And wow did Ryan do a really good job portraying this man! You really find yourself feeling for Ida Lupino as he destroys her life So with such intense acting and menace why is the movie rated relatively low? Well probably because it isnt exactly believablebut boy is it entertaining and creative Give it a try and dont believe the score of 64--its a lot better than that!
Intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house (Lupino excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant housecleaner (Ryan) The 2 masters of the genre are at their heady erotic best as they match wits emotions and wills in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the Saturday Evening Post Richly hued B & W photography with an unusual amount of close-up head shots The young girl who teases Ryan is really well directed here Improbable but satisfying suburban melodrama
Beware My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man Harry Horner better known for his set designs Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesnt know it Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over to little avail He is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well but one of them cant do well because there is something wrong with him He suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence which he later forgets br br Essentially the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey or in another sense a sadist The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer but it takes Lupino much longer Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to win Ryan over in order to make things work get the job done get on with life But getting on with things isnt in Ryans makeup as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself br br As a study in mental illness the movie isnt too impressive What its superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness with dangerous psychopathology in the mix and its effect on a normal person In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino cant fix Ryan yet we want her to The result is that if one is willing one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside so to speak its melodramatic structurebr br Horner shows us gradually the layout the Lupino house  a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home We become familiar with staircase kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which ones she cant
I first saw this as a kid (THE LITTLE RASCALS first went on TV the year I was born) and fairly recently bought this on DVD In between I watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as a Nubian slave doing voodoo for example I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if theyd tried to do that nowbr br Notice how the pie fights in The Three Stooges HALFWITS HOLIDAY and IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE resemble this oneand this film came out a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures There was obviously some inspiration from SS and Laurel & Hardys THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these filmsremember at that time they all stole from the best each other!!! br br One more note: Laurel & Hardy buffs that bake sale lady was none other than Dorothy Coburn who also appeared in TBOTC-the flapper getting into her car and getting it in the rear end It always escapes me why she was never credited?
Shivering Shakespeare could be considered the first classic of the Our Gang talkie era By now Hal Roach Studios began to hit their stride in making talking pictures and Shakespeare is the happy resultbr br The Gang is appearing in a version of Quo Vadis produced by Kennedy the Cops wife The kids dont find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines Among the funniest bits are Kennedy the Cop as the giant who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume; and the terrible dancing girl (played by director Bob McGowans daughter)br br Several filmographies mention that Shakespeare has the first pie fight in a talkie This may be true seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight Buster Keatons brother Harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies Very funny and an early Gang talkie classic 9 out of 10
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine Id be able to relate to this film perfectly Its pace as well as the dialog churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their headsbr br There are great little elements that pop up through out the film like how Rob Lowes character seems to always be loosing a shoe or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawlessbr br The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness This is one I think most could enjoy A few laugh-out-loud-even-if-you-are-alone moments ensure that Ill certainly be watching this again
This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough The acting and plot arent that impressive but the lines just keep on coming This catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like well a bad movie but its so kooky that you cant help but be amused The spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going I was especially fond of Sharon the Canuck on Shrooms eh? However the one that really stole the show was Richards little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden) his high pitched whining was somehow endearing The whole movie rocked
This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen This in my opinion is Rob Lowe at his best Im not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating I guess you either love it or hate it but if nothing else it is definitely worth a rental
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era but I recommend that all others beware Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough but theres no real pacing or tension in the story I also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying partially due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording I give this a 55100 Most folks will want to steer clear
br br MILD SPOILERS AHEADbr br We Dive at Dawn is an English made movie with John Mills in the lead role The second time I watched the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I must say the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the samll screen May be it was the big screen viewing that helped?br br I still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission the movie takes off too! The search for the German battleship named the Brandenburg and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting!br br Im increasing my rating to 710 If you enjoy WW II films I think youll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway Some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor too!
I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In Which We Serve The scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ships company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s) Some of the throwaway lines are very witty (Im not joining the Band of Hope just to please some greasy fish fryer!) My only complaint is that they didnt show what happened to the Irish coxswain and his bride to be or the tattooed PO and his I Love Arabella tattoo!
If youre in the middle of a ferocious war and its still not clear that youre going to come out on top among the things youll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civiliansto demonstrate that our troops have the bravery the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause And thats just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with 1943s naval war film We Dive at Dawn After more than 60 years its not surprising that some of the movie is dated It doesnt help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring Here as in so many other British war films the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at home in Englands finest ruling-class establishments In this movie Freddie Taylor (John Mills) the captain of the submarine Sea Tiger is clever confident resourceful aggressive in control good with his men humorous with his peers quick to make a decision And it helps that hes lucky His men are jolly tars for the most part competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense Although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while theyre on leave after that things get tense quickly br br Taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg a new German battleship They just miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and heads into the Baltic Taylor assesses the risks and decides the Sea Tiger will go after it through mine fields anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base After several tense situations the confrontation takes place The Sea Tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive not knowing if it had done its job After a clever subterfuge Taylor outfoxes a couple of German destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel He plans to scuttle his sub and surrender when just at the last moment James Hobson (Eric Portman) a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who speaks German says there is a small Danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot He thinks it might still be for the Germans The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain This is a wartime propaganda movie so dont expect failure And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? Youll have to see the movie br br There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies Some like Powells and Pressburgers One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didnt use obvious shorthand clichés Others like We Dive at Dawn were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made Still Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés The Sea Tigers forcing its way through a sub net was tense The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mills no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic inside the sub as well as out as you could hope for and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film but its a well-made well-acted example of its type and time br br John Mills its worth noting had a long long career Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days He had the quality of showing grit cheerfulness and perseverance but of also being trustworthy a man England could be proud of as he fought the war Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold youd want to put on a sweater Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode but Portman manages some complexity for his character Mills and Portman did fine jobs working together on this film
This is an excellent tub-thumper from the war yearsbr br John Mills leads a fine cast of regular British B-movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleshipbr br Filmed in black and white its well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time If anything it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propagandabr br The mission-side of the movie takes place in genuine submarines Things are cramped and claustrophobic The actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate Other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments as well as the engine-room activitiesbr br This probably is the first movie in which debris (and a dead German) is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer And its the ONLY time I have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking - a high risk gamble if ever there was onebr br Im a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire-rope net Submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed and the net would have had a great deal of give Also the engineer was at the same work-station and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged This too seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship - or so Im toldbr br There was a wee bit too much shore-side drama for my tastes But then this was a propaganda effort and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effortbr br These niggles aside its a pretty entertaining little adventure Nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime-time But then; its no longer politically-correct to mention the war in the presence of our European friends (Too many of them have guilty consciences) or our own left-wing fascists (non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted)br br As a submarine movie it is eminently collectible Better than The Enemy Below I think though less demonstrative Not so authentic as Das Boot by any means but not so gross either
Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion respectfully The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War Two and particularly naval warfare I favor depictions of subs and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of things For those unacquainted with target priorities an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing Rank and British-Gaumont studios back in the day: frankly I prefer its quieter more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced Hollywood movie ever could This reminds me of Powell and Pressburgers The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman a favorite of mine John Mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles so this is clearly meant to be Mr Portmans film but the whole cast shines As for the title sequence am I the only one who is utterly charmed by Gainsborough Productions lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl?
The submarine used was NOT Varangian! It was in fact two boats P614 and P615 both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945 br br The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted outbr br There are some extremely realistic moments in the film These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class As no S-class submarines survive the shots of them (as P61) and of the depot ship Forth form part of an interesting record now as well as an excellent film
This movie is all about reality submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science There were no computers giving exact enemy details there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub Not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart and a smile on their dialbr br People with expectations of seeing a pretty war in this movie will be grossly disappointed  GOOD they deserve to be disappointed they deserve to have reality shoved into their facebr br War is not clean exact fought by people about to break into song It is endured by scared coldburnt hungry desperate people willing to do anything to survivebr br We Dive at Dawn is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions
As a teenager I watched this movie every time it was on TV (and it was on a LOT) because of its witty appealing-to-teenager humor It may not be what critics consider 4 star viewing but I love it for what it is--a fun comedy meant to please the audience The teen actors are of my generation (probably why I love the movie so much) and was like a fantasy cast of everyones favorite TV shows of the early 90s--Full House Family Matters Fresh Prince--all of the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90s Though it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen movie writers think vital to success among the youth demographic (or perhaps because of its absence) I highly recommend it to pre-teens and teenagers everywhere
I think this movie is my favorite movie I am not sure why but it is Julia Duffy has been my favorite actress for awhile and when I saw this I went crazy Its sort of romantic and I definitely recommend this movie
This was a excellent back when it came out It had some the best talent available and a funny story Between Candace Cameron and Tatyana Ali it was hard to choose who is cuter and add in Carlton from Fresh Prince and all the other big names and you get a blockbuster Ok a made for TV blockbuster but none the less If you can find this move dont miss itbr br 
Glenn Ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and wily stable owner Edger Buchanan to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot With Ford a no-show the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice leaving Ford on the hook for killings he didnt commitbr br Columbia Pictures first color feature The Desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes fabricated to take full advantage of the Technicolor process accentuating tons of well staged western spectaclebr br This has the irresistible teaming of a young Glenn Ford (third-billed but essentially the star) and a prime Randolph Scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles including scene-stealer Edger Buchanan as a good-natured but mildly villainous yokel who isnt as dumb as he looks and who has quite a few memorable linesbr br A fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences melodrama and comedy well directed by Charles Vidor This is one of the great westerns of the nineteen-forties and highly recommended
This is simply a good ole fashioned westernnot overly complex or long It doesnt deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment Still it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Fords Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals Scotts Sheriff Steve Uptons horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving) In Red valley Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta a friend of Cheyennes who gives he and buddy Nitro(Guinn Big Boy Williams)a place to stay for the time being Cheyenne desires to go straight but finds that hard when Jack Lester(Bernard Nedell)and his bad bunch want to rob Red Valleys bank It is actually Jack who is behind the murders but Cheyennes troubled past is hard to get away from He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they didnt commit(the robbery was one Cheyenne didnt commit)and it will be Upton who must somehow save the day before Lester gets away with murder There are sub-plots which include Cheyennes falling in love with Alison McLeod{Evelyn Keyes;the irony of the story is that Alisons father Uncle Willie is actually in cahoots with Banker Stanley Clanton(Porter Hall)in a planned united theft with Lester to steal the town of Red Valleys loot} Will Upton uncover Uncle Willie and Banker Clantons treacherous scheme? Will Uncle Willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him? This film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout Columbia couldnt have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such Dont expect to get your socks blown off but the film is simple and well paced
i liked this western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Fordits got pretty much everything a western should havetheres gunfightsactionchases on horsebacktheres a bit of a romance angle thats hinted attheres some nice comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchananwho plays Uncle Willie McLeoda character who pretend to be a doddering old foolbut is actually aware of everything going onRandolph Scott plays the town Sheriffand Glenn Ford Plays Cheyenne RogersBill Smitha hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his waysi liked the different mix of characters in the moviei didnt find it always fast pacedbut i never found it boring eithereven though the movie is in 1943it is in colour 810
Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once outlaw pals together but now Scotts a sheriff and young Ford is still hiring his gun out He gets hired to pull a bank job but is delayed getting to town and those that hired him get someone else That leads to all kinds of complications a lot for a film thats not even 90 minutes longbr br Randy and Glenn both got girls here Claire Trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls for Ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that Scott is the sheriff inbr br Its B western but unusual for the time and for Columbia Pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment The Desperadoes marked Glenn Fords first film in technicolor a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios Harry Cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it And definitely not during war timebr br The plot gets a bit convoluted as both Ford and Scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediencyduty The plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in Randys town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concernedbr br The four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is Guinn Williams as Fords lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick The climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western filmbr br Fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one
Probably because this is Columbias first film in color the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes They seem to be stronger sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic but very pleasing Randolph Scott is the sheriff a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford who is an outlaw that wants to change Evelyn Keyes is the woman that starts falling for Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess that runs the saloon There is a funny character called Nitro that does not think twice before blowing it I particularly enjoyed two moments of the film one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses there was no computer to help at that time so I presume they must have gathered all those horses no easy task Another moment is the final shootout technically very good There is also quite a fistfight Seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes makes you come to a sad conclusion: They dont make them anymore Would they be able to in case they wanted? I have my doubts
The Desperadoes (1943) is a genuine classic not for its story (which is fairly routine) but for its technical production elements This was a landmark western the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a Columbia production-a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation Only Foxs Jesse James (also starring Randolph Scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre Although it would be eclipsed in a few years by The Searchers and High Noon The Desperadoes was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure br br In 1863 the economy in the town of Red Valley Utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army The script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in Utahs future) and Custers Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements br br Red Valley has an honest sheriff Steve Upton (Scott) but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses The town is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford) a famous outlaw who is an old friend Steves He wants to go straight especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes) Cheyennes partner Nitro Rankin (Guinn Big Boy Williams) is mainly there for comic relief as are Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the town judge (Raymond Walburn who models his character on Frank Morgans Wizard of Oz crystal ball faker) br br Taking no chances with their huge budget Columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but Indians and covered wagons There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed a spectacular barroom brawl an explosive climax romance and three-strip Technicolor All this stuff doesnt necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943 Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy br br The cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming The indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences br br Scott and Claire Trevor were top billed but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford who would soon be their biggest star And Director Charles Vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarletts sister in Gone With the Wind had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films) br br The Ford-Keyes dynamic is The Desperadoes most unique and important feature Rather than go for the cliché love triangle with Scott andor Trevor (which it first appears will happen) the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors This was probably the best role Keyes ever got and she makes the most of it Playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightleys character in Pirates of the Caribbean This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the WAAC for WWII military service br br The Desperadoes is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD br br Then again what do I know? Im only a child
This movie was very good I really enjoyed it Tom McCamus performance was excellent and very believable as the consumptive son Edmund I also enjoyed the set design (house) and the costumes
This is a great movie The best role Peter Strauss ever did The music is good the message harsh the actors great and the story is both emotional and raw Only in the seventies did they make them like this one!
I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature Finally!!!!! Its about time Hollywood got their act together The big Studios always frown at edgy material with Oscar written all over it Go figure!!br br JERICHO MILE was made ahead of its time Its a masterpiecebr br Michael Mann a true visionary found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence Peter Strauss Emmy award performance is probably the best character role Ive seen in my film-viewing lifetime Any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless an Academy Award is already sitting on their mantle)br br The gritty multi ethnic ensemble a backdrop for THE JERICHO MILE makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world This is about redemption without public validation and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers Imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole that doesnt know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world what would you do??br br This movie makes you walk away feeling you havent been cheated on any level Totally thrilling engaging emotional and a Rolling Stones soundtrack that kicks ass!!!br br I always thought this would be made for the big screen Cant wait!!! In the meantime Ill have to continue re-watching my weathered VHS copy Ive had for many years
The first time I saw this film I was a kid I was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters I saw it on Network TV I remember watching it aloneand crying afterward It was only the second film to illicit that response (Rocky was the first) and there havent been many since I cant say why exactly; Larry Rain Murphy didnt deserve to win any more that Rocky Balboa or anyone else I know I admired Murphy not so much for what he did but for the way he did his time Stoic He didnt need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity He ran because he could He needed no other reason I have a rule today that when I see this film late at night on cable television (the only time most will come across it) I must watch no matter what I have to do the next morning Fortunately it doesnt play often like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites so I still get plenty of sleep and I never tire of the story of one mans unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory
A film that deserved theatrical release This made-for-television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of Michael Mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images Always with Mr Mann the amplification of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy-award-winning actor added to the ensemble of cast writer director and cinematographerbr br This film is definitely one of my all time favorites While nothing is perfect this film comes very very closebr br Along with an excellent script great direction and masterful acting by Richard Strauss there is an all-star ensemble of character actors at their finest: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush You may not recognize the names but you will recognize every facebr br If this comes on TV sit down with popcorn turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film I highly recommend recording it since it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and the DVD is region 2 encoded
i love watching the Jericho mile i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter i think peter Strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing no man alive can out race rain Murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him ive watched the Jericho mile 100s of times and will watch it 100s more great movies get watched more than movies that are not i thank the makers of this film for giving years of there lives to make itthey are great people and i bless them allthank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all
Peter Strauss by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - Usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film having channel-hopped into it half-way through Well Ive just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film!!br br Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much br br Looking to be objective I attempted to criticise this film Instead I found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit-picks This is what true realistic film-making is about This is not your typical Hollywood sensationalism where everything is overacted - Its so realistic and true to life that people have thought its based on a real event!!
I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (Im not sure why -- Im sure some shrink could make something out of it!) I spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago and I knew then I would never go back - I got the individual version of scared straight! (I did get locked up in an isolation cell on Alcatraz for a couple of hours compliments of a park ranger but thats another story!) Anyway the genre really interests me The soundtrack specifically Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones was the perfect backdrop for the film To this day I think of The Jericho Mile every time I hear the song
An interesting and involved film about a lifer just trying to live out his days peacefully Elements of the main character appear in Michael Manns later films like Thief (1981) Heat (1995) and so on You can see this one at the UCLA Instructional Media Laboratory-- one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public Its a great one!
Ive never given a movie a ten out of ten before but this is the closest I have ever come (I gave it a 9) There are very few movies that I truly love this however is one of them With its gritty realism fantastic on-site locationing and its great soundtrack it literally blew my young mind when I first saw it in 1979 At that point I didnt know about prisons violence racial tensions or the struggle to survive & live free I doubt that anyone who is an adult or for that matter anyone who is growing up in todays world could be impacted by this film in the same way I was all those years ago but I will say this: if you havent seen this movie I envy you; this is because you have the chance to see this great film for the frist time For each of us theyre different but heres to the rarest movies of them all: the ones we actually love
I watched the this the other night on a local station because I didnt feel like watching tripe like American Idol Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named Rain Murphy who keeps to himself He admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it His cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures The only time he feels in another zone is in running He does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes When a college coach hears about this he wants to prime him for a shot at the Olympics At first Rain wants no part of this but when his best friend is killed he shows interestbr br This is a good movie period Strauss is very good (What did you expect anything less?) and Michael Mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later This movie had that bit of realism (probably because it was filmed among convicts) It almost feels like this was a true story The additional casting is good There is a lot of notable names like Brian Dennehy Roger E Mosley and Richard Moll as wellbr br My heart sank when some pompous board of directors wouldnt let him run because he didnt feel bad for his crime His final act made me stand up and cheer When they took his dreams away he took them back hard This was back when TV movies were actually good The Jericho Mile is a gem of a film ESPN Classic PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM!!!
I watch a lot of movies - DVD features and classics you name it The night I watched JERICHO MILE my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school that it had stayed with her all of these years Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter & son) and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles We all were br br She who remembered the original and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldnt believe it Our favorite scene? Bar none when peter Strauss so passionately bangs his fist down and says id do it AGAIN! It didnt advocate violence because it was a defense crime but evoked such intensity we couldnt believe itwhen his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts there wasnt a dry eye in our housebr br Someone please make more movies like this one UNBELIEVABLE!!
The film is not for everyone Some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural There are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments There is a lot of indecision an lot of conflicting feelingsbr br Actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject Sex with minors It is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing Complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with minors and complex because the characters dont know if society is right or if their instincts are rightbr br Some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions Questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship who was damaged did good come out of it was it art who was damaged more did some of the problems with their relationship stem from it being forbidden by society did some of the problems stem from their own immaturity and probably most important was this truly a crime?br br The film is resolutely neutral on all of this and it is this neutrality that is its strength It is the reason for the understated acting the simple sets the lack of background music soft lighting and the general flat presentation The message is clear We dont really understand this kind of relationship today and quick judgments are bound to be shallow
Jennifer Montgomerys Art for Teachers of Children is a stunning disturbing masterpiece Montgomerys gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifers seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifers mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful Ive ever seen captured on film The lesson ultimately learned here? Theres nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art Well I would highly recommend this remarkable piece of Art for anyone interested in thought-provoking independent cinema
To summerize this movie: nice for TV but too small for the theatre I enjoyed watching this movie at home but I wont watch it a second time The concept is good but what ends up in the movie is just a summary The end had a nice twist but is still unsatisfying Maybe it was the intention of the director but it wasnt worked out like a it should be But then again its an OK kind of movie
If you enjoy riddles and suspense you will enjoy this movie Truth be told it was mostly the Adrian Paul part that got me to pick it up I knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope) a student of philosophy and metaphysics starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out the reason and gets involved in the game by solving riddles Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner also a riddle fanatic and also gets entangled in the game Myth has it that if you solve the game the meaning of existence (referred to as The Design) is revealed Brendan Fehrs character is a village idiot type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than he seems All in all I thought the movie was pretty well done And its definitely an original concept a rare find these days! I personally happen to like riddles and puns so while most of them werent very difficult it was still a fun movie Well worth the rentalbr br  So if you havent seen it -- get it! :-Dbr br 
This is a cult classic for sure!!br br It is tricky to follow at times but then again so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club If you want standard fare then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic But if you want  to view the world differently then i would say open yourself up to Enigmas and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and thinkbr br For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout So while i have seen some complaints all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy
I watched this film not knowing anything about it I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort How wrong I was The plot is enthralling and intelligent the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change Some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple I am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as I thought it was quite unusual If you liked the film Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix then you will like this There is no major special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all It is all about the plot about building the characters and building an atmosphere It is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may irk some people but I thought the ending was great I am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark  mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman ( Vern and Sarah )  each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past  Fine dialogue and first-rate casting propel this low key noirish journey into the girls search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life Aided by her  anything but enthusiastic male friend the two of them reach the end of their quest  but with a price to be paid The film never intends to answer all of its mysteries  but does an excellent job in the exposition of several plot twists
I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind The trauma the suspense is just amazing I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it and relating it to reality Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you dont forget those that make you doubt your reality A problem could be the quality but that doesnt bring down the essence of the moviebr br The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer I just totally loved it! So many clues and twitches and puzzles One of the best movies ever hands down
this film was probably the best scary film ive seen in years chilling might be a more accurate description the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept since noone truly knows that answer you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry the rest of the cast were somewhat shaky however since the focus was on sara novak (carly pope) her performance anchored the movie the at times poor acting abilities of her costars were not an issue since it was not their performances that fuelled this movie (thankfully) watch this movie you should enjoy itbr br t
What can I say? Not as bad as many here have made it out to be The only reason I even watched this film that I had previously never heard of before was strictly for IAN McSHANEbr br I was not disappointed in the least IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role Hes always great to watch and for my money an extremely underused actorbr br As for the rest of the film Every other actor in the movie delivered strong solid performances These people certainly werent being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a fairly low budget film) but this did not mean that any of them mailed their appearances in Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to thembr br I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAULs performance though I must admit I have only ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this moviebr br The plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film Anybody who expected a clear-cut by-the-numbers connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie CLEARLY wasnt watching the film closely enough! This film is not going to tell you what the meaning of life is! The idea is that after seeing the film you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee I certainly didbr br No car chases No explosions No bar room brawls (sounds pretty dull huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by the film and its just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involvedbr br  WARNING If youre the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous question as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directlybr br YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS FILM
A raw edgy thriller that aimed for great philosophical heights it couldnt quite attain I did still enjoy the film immensely It had great elements of suspense leaving me with that delightful spine chill I expect from thrillers and it achieved this purely psychologically without resorting to escalating blood and gore The soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly At times it was a bit unpolished particularly the acting and character development It could only have been a better film if we had known more about the nightmares from the past the characters see when they close their eyes and why they felt this desperate need to seek the answer that is so integral to the storyline After all they seemed to continue to seek it despite knowing or at least having an inkling of what might happen when they found it I would recommend seeing this film if you are prepared to look beyond the grit to see the potential of a diamond in the rough
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school I thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles I think the type of people that wouldnt like this movie would be those who dont like solving things or those who get frustrated when they cant solve riddles its a good movie based on a true story that happened in my home town of Toronto Ontario so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there watch this movie And for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws realize that in real life this same stuff does happen but thats all I want to say on that The riddles are good some are hard some are not But the movie also leaves you wanting more more riddles more explanation just plainly more Something more I want to add is that the ideas within this movie the underground riddle world does exist but there is a lot more to it To find it you can not look for it To never look for it would be no way to find it Leave your mark and it will find you
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you dont have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching) but I think that is totally missing the point If your expecting fast cars T&A or a movie that will spell itself out for you then dont watch this youll be disappointed and dumbfoundedbr br This movie was thoroughly enjoyable kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think The writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end just remember to keep an open mindbr br Note: the school scenes were all filmed at McMaster University and most of the rest was done in Toronto
Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles death mystery and philosophy In its simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when youve finally found them all The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth yet Sarah is so close to understanding it all What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?br br The movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn While this was Warns first feature length film the movie doesnt reflect that at all but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch I would definitely love to see more of her workbr br Being based on riddles this is a very cerebral movie Its thats your thing as it is mine then I totally recommend seeing Nemesis Game Rating: 455
As a late-going patron of the drive-in thearers (1970s-1980s) there are many movies that I have seen & forgotten This is one I could never forget Despite its low-budget exploitation-style of movie-making the STORY was very well done The isolated therapy-asylum where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their phsycosis the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene the (supposed) assistant doctor taking over the various crazy paitents the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself and finally the rescue of the young nurse by the simple-minded Sam who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape unharmed made for a great STORY which held the film together I emphasised the word STORY because thats what makes a good or great film No matter how much blood gore nudity sexual matter or outrageous behaviour you put in a film if the STORY is not good then the film is not good The film credits show clips of all the actors including the old hag with the final line telling you to get out & never come back which is a great ending to this film If it is out on videoDVD see it & enjoy it
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by Dr Geraldine S Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick) Among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the luscious Betty Chandler) loopy Judge Oliver W Cameron (a gloriously hammy Gene Ross) paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin) gentle giant Sam (the amiable William Bill McGhee) and nutty old hag Mrs Callingham (the supremely irritating Rhea MacAdams) Said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by Dr Masters which of course results in a rash of brutal killings Director SF Brownrigg working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by Tim Pope does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocatingly dank and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia Robert Farrars spooky score the grimy set design a few wild grisly murders Bruce B Alcotts grungy no-frills cinematography plenty of deliciously robust scenery-scarfing histrionics from a game no-name cast (Ross in particular is a total eye-rolling hoot) and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall infectiously seedy fun of this choice trashy chunk of 70s low-budget regional horror exploitation cinema
This film also known as dont look in the basement is actually not bad It is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but I found this movie pretty entertaining Dont get me wrong its certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me I thought the acting  which seemed forced at first somehow got better as the film went along It seems like the actors really got into their roles There are some good colorful characters including a guy who thinks hes still a soldier one who thinks hes a judge an adult with a childs brain and an attractive girl who craves attention so bad she drops her clothes when any man gets near her The title dont look in the basement has about as much relevance to the story as the last house on the left has on that film If you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like I do check this out
Dont Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting Sure its not a masterpiece by anyones standards but it is a very fun little B-film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your headbr br As I said the acting could have been a lot better but thats the case with most exploitation so I cant really complain The story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing I thought the gore was a lot of fun too Theres just something great about older gore films because they didnt have CGI back then so they had to actually set it all up themselves See this one for a good time!
I just discovered this obscure 70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube For a low-budget effort it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish While there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly the fact that shes a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and theres one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad The young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and Im not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy Some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous For the most part however Dont Look in the Basement (Thats the title I saw on YouTube) provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining B-movie
Clearly my rating for this is not to suggest it compares with the classy horrors of the likes of Argento but with other 70s low budget drive in fare and in that department it truly is a classic The lack of money shows (Does anyone care too much?) the acting is adequate rather than professional (Does that make it more realistic?) but unlike so many other movies and not just low budget ones this does not drag for a moment Crap it may be but non stop crap in your face crap and although inevitably a bit campy at times this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what Im talking about At times quite delirious this crazy little film filled out with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun indeed it is to watch
Widely known as Dont Look in the Basement - this is pure 70s horror B-movie goodness that could actually pass as the genres version of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest Though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour+ of its runtime I enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies - such as the former army sergeant a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll a lovable man-child and a loony nymph After their head-doctor is murdered by a patient a small sanitarium hires a new nurse onto their under-staffed facility who becomes immersed in the residents different ticks and outbursts Things gradually become stranger however when patients start acting far more abnormal than usual You never really know or care where the movie is going cause it still entertains up until its completely whacked-out ending! Several of the twists felt a little too forced and I could have used a tad more blood but I really dug this much too under-rated blend of humor and horror Check it out
Back in the 70s a small-time Texas filmmaker named SF Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years Before viewing his first film Dont Look In The Basement I wasnt too sure what to expect but I sure as hell didnt expect it to turn out to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre I dont know this might actually be my all-time favorite horror moviebr br We begin in an isolated insane asylum At first it seems like a rather laid-back place to get mentally healthy considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot as if it were their house (I guess it is) none of them seem all that dangerous only delusional The residents include a love-nympho a 700 year old woman a man-child a spaz a guy who thinks hes in a war a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks hes a judge One day out of nowhere Judge kills the doctor with an axe shortly thereafter the wanna-be baby mama kills the nurse Ten minutes into the movie and things are looking really ugly Perhaps the new nurse will know what to do then again perhaps not Giving away more would do more harm than good Its best to plunge head first into this one knowing as little as possible If you can appreciate honest-to-God untampered with horror then you will not be disappointed br br If you liked Scream if you liked Wrong Turn if you go for that unoriginal over-produced over-scored digital Hollywood garbage then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one Dont Look In The Basement being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking The atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove Unfortunately good ol SF used up most of his good ideas on his first movie although the next entry in his Texas-sized quadrilogy is somewhat of a masterpiece that is if youre into extra sleazy mean-spirited Hixploitation like someone I know If you fall in love with Brownriggs first two and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer check out Dont Open The Door and The House Where Hell Froze Over Dont Look in The Basement has everything that successful horror needs no stars no budget no digital effects just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum with a dozen cast members and a somber subtle score and of course the twist This is real horror for the real horror fan 1010
Although it isnt mentioned very often Dont Look in the Basement is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch The story follows a young nurse Charlotte Beale who is hired at Stephens Sanitarium to replace Dr Stephens after he is murdered by a patient Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale and her boss Dr Geraldine Masters acts as if shes hiding somethingbr br This movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about and have sympathy for during the climax which doesnt happen very often in horror films The musical score is great and is reminiscent of Dark Shadows the performance from Rosie Holotik Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee are all great the story is very intriguing with a great twist ending This movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other film I have ever seen has been able to capture Many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic Dont Look in the Basement is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive-in films
A nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by Doctor Stephens She is upset to learn that the doctor has diedleaving his assistant Doctor Masters in chargeShe is unnerved by the inmates including a crazy Judgea shell-shocked Vietnam veta catatonic and a creepy nymphobut is soon befriended by a hulking black man SamShe needs all the friends she can get as people are dying all around herDont Look in the Basement is my first horror film of SF BrownriggDespite its low-budget it manages to provide some genuine chills plus a nice amount of cheap gore including a particularly nasty scene with a desk-spindle through an eyeballThe climax of inmates taking control over mental asylum is an intense melange of wild camera-workgore and piercing screams8 out of 10
Dr Stephens (Michael Harvey) head of a seriously understaffed institute for the insane takes a progressive approach towards the treatment of his patients even allowing his loonies complete freedom of the building day and night; he pays the price for his forward thinking however when he rather stupidly prescribes chopping wood with an axe as therapy for one of his patients and consequently gets his neck mistaken for a log (serves him right for not suggesting basket weaving)br br Shortly after this tragic incident nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to take up position as the doctors assistant and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much sterner Dr Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick) Despite being unaware of her deceased predecessors decision to employ Ms Beale and not particularly eager to take on new staff Dr Masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work but following several harrowing experiences at the hospital Charlotte begins to wonder whether it might have been better if she had been turned awaybr br It doesnt take a genius to figure out what is actually happening at the hospital the lunatics have taken over the asylum schtick being a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans but SF Brownriggs Dont Look In The Basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive-in fun thanks to its well defined collection of nutters: lobotomised popsicle-sucking Sam (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W Cameron (Gene Ross) who continuously mumbles courtroom phrases; old Mrs Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) who recites William Allinghams creepy poem The Fairies and warns Charlotte of impending doom; cackling loon Danny (Jessie Kirby) who delights in teasing the other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr) who thinks her doll is a real baby; army nut Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all Allyson King (Betty Chandler) whose rejection by a series of men has left her with a craving for love (ie she tries to jump any man who goes near her)br br This convincingly crazy set of characters plus a bit of gore and nudity reasonable direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us the impressive white trash horror Scum of the Earth) and a solid turn from Playboy covergirl Holotik all go to turn an otherwise rather predictable low budget piece of exploitation into a very watchable psycho shocker
Im not sure what intrigues me about this movie so It is grainy poorly written bleached out often ridiculous and at many points mind numbingly dull (the person I was watching it with fell asleep twice) And yet there is something in this film that fascinates me though I am not sure what; perhaps the character of Sam an enormous former patient who was lobotimized by the former head doctor and who is perpetually sucking on an ice pop) or the marvelously played head doctor (I forget her name)br br Anyway watch it and form youre own opinion; it has one of the greatest endings I have seen in film
Young ambitious nurse Ms Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere During the course of 3 days she encounters strange happenings even a patient in her bedroom watching her yet she still stays The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (espically by the Judge) but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams) The storyline is okay at best and the acting is surprisingly alright but after awhile its gets to be a little much But still its fun quirky strange and originalbr br Note: The thing inside the basement is hardly horrifying so the title is a little bananas
Dont Look In the Basement is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horrors real underground stars and IMHO is vastly overdue some proper recognition Dont is his undisputed masterpiece This scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd disjointed claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on It succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty just plain grubby for Brownriggs world is this mad unwashed scummy prison cell of rants obsessions and all shades of mental illness And he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grot blanket around you like a bad memory There is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing In a word classic Also if you watch Dont first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks Brownriggs other films In summary they really dont come any more esoteric than this - well actually they do track down Brownriggs Keep My Grave Open Mad genius Accept no substitute
 but you probably have seen it or else you wouldnt be here Its so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like I did because this little known gem receives no word-of-mouthbr br From the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but Dont Look in the Basement plays it subtle which makes for superior suspense Note to horror filmmakers: some of us do like subtlety! Lovely and homely nurse Charlotte takes a job at a sanitarium but is dismayed when she learns that the head doctor who hired her had a gruesome accident and she is now the subordinate to a mysterious doctor who we all know isnt a doctor at all The suspense is built through Charlottes unraveling of events with assistance from many of the patients but which of the patients can Charlotte trust? This is a gem and is my absolute favorite TRUE HORROR movie I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead but they play more for the HORROR-COMEDY crowdbr br VIOLENCE: $$$ (Quite tame for horror standards but there is a decent sprinkling of gore throughout the film The opening scene is classic; no other horror film starts out better and the end has its fair share of gore as well)br br NUDITY: $$$$ (Eager to fall in love Allyson (Betty Chandler) spends a good deal of time naked attempting to seduce half the men at the sanitarium Betty Chandler is a knockout and I am shocked that this is her only film credit)br br STORY: $$$$ (The story is well handled despite the premise getting a lot of mileage in Hollywood The script has a knack for building suspense and never fails to place poor Charlotte in a precarious situation)br br ACTING: $$$$ (Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson capturing dementia with naiveté in an ethereal form The Judge was splendid as well weighing facts before he came to a verdict while Rosie Holotik as Charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for her character
DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties List The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic The main character although way hotter than most low budget starlets is a pretty standard low budget lead The Doctor Masters character is well written and well acted Some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie Its Campy I aint trying to lie The character that makes this great is a Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-mad-flick The gore is pretty standard although I think the color of the blood is awesome Its so Red This movie I believe was received poorly because of it advertising scheme Some soulless little ad executive got his grubby hands on it and thought  Lets rip of the AD campaign for Last House on the Left thats doing well Little chumps like this have ruined the world of film All balls and no brain Also the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic Maybe there all drunk Youll see what I mean One more little note Dont buy this from the Wally-Mart dollar rack They have cut it to and unwatchable level Try to find the longest cut you can
Yet another in the long line of Dont films of the late 70s and early 80s yet this one is much more than that This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but its the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actorsactresses that make this movie good A young nurse arrives at Dr Stephens progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be It seems Dr Masters a rather ambitious female doctor has taken over his duties and begun to implement her own ideas Each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions There is the nymphomaniac the crazy old crone the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants and a man who has reverted back to his childhood among others There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies piling up If you are a fan of cheap 70s sleaze than this is the film for you!
The impossibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale a new nurse at one of those movie-type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own unorthodox ways of treating the inmates Reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious Dr Masters (Anne MacAdams aka Annabelle Weenick) The inmates dont take too kindly to Charlotte eitherbr br Part mystery part horror this initial effort from B-movie director SF Brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it These colorful psychos including a nymphomaniac with no self-esteem a gentle giant whos already had a lobotomy and a supposed judge who speaks in legalese jargon dominate the screen with their unnerving presencebr br Its a picture that works fairly well establishing the gritty grim atmosphere right from the get go Some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative qualitybr br It builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity offering one surreal encounter after another Particularly effective is the poetry-quoting dotty old Mrs Callinghambr br For cheap 1970s era cheese its pretty effective with a particularly nasty climax I had a pretty good time watching itbr br 710
I found the film Dont Look In The Basement to be very good with some great characters in it It is about a young psychiatric nurse called Nurse Charlotte Beale(Rosie Holotik)who is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum Whilst there she meets various sorts of different characters including Dr Geraldine Masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital Dr Stephens gets killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an axebr br My favourite characters in the film are Mrs Challingham(Reah MacAdams) a very funny little old lady Allison who is a nymphomaniac and Sam(Bill McGhee) a young black guy who goes around all Day seeming to be in a world of his own all of the time The film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film I know that it was on the Video Nasties list back in the 80s but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it Alothough it did have some disturbing senses in it GREAT FILM RECOMMENDED!!!
I personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in hospitals and asylums so I had a good feeling about watching this Dont Look in the Basement even though its reputation is doubtful Well turned out I was right! This is great trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters You have to of course look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but if you manage to do that (and if youre a fan of this type of horror thats an essential quality) youll be rewarded with an outrageous video-nasty in which blood and insanity form the main elements The young and cute nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where shes supposed to start her new job She finds out that the Doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctor-in-charge Masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival The life inside the sanitarium is rather peculiar with the patients running around free and every door is kept unlocked After a whole series of bizarre events Charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides The opening 10 minutes (pre-credits) are great and so is the completely deranged climax Everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you patiently wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun The asylums patients are textbook lunatics but I love them nevertheless Some of my favorites include the former judge (who still talks exclusively in legal terms) the suspicious army-Sargeant and the mad-raving old lady Dont Look in the Basement is great low-brained fun especially recommended to fans of 70s trash-cinema sick puppies and other types of scum The lunatics have taken over the asylum yeah!!
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre Vulnerable naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her br br The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style as well as a cast of wacky characters The pleasures of this film dont come from the films shocks which are fairly tame but from the weird atmosphere First we have the delusional woman who thinks her baby doll is real Theres also an axe-murdering judge a shell-shocked war veteran and old Mrs Callahan is like everybodys daffy elderly grandmother gone amok A young patient named Allyson gives the term nymphomaniac new meaning A big guy named Sam is just a little slow after a botched lobotomy and Jennifer vaults suddenly between catatonia and violent outbursts The only other sentient person in the place seems to be Dr Masters but does she have a secret?br br Dont Look in the Basement is a great example of low-budget exploitation films There isnt much plot going on but the cheapness works for the movie Several cast members turn in memorable performances particularly Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick and the way the director adds little weird details to the movie can really stick with youbr br The scene between Allyson and the telephone man is a classic for all time and especially delicious are the facial expressions of Dr Masters when she begins to go over the edge near the finale of the movie Brownrigg also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack with several musical cues really evoking the characters that they accompany My favorite cue is the crazy cue a sitar that twangs whenever one of the patients does something pathologicalbr br Also wonderful is the way that Charlotte herself plunges into hysteria at the climax with the patients revealing that Dr Masters is simply another inmate and then suggesting that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is being allowed to act out her delusions (she certainly has a tenuous grip on reality why else would she not question the ominous lack of phone service or outside contact?) The scene where Charlotte manages to finish off the barely-alive Dr Stephens with a toy boat has to be one of the greatest moments in low-budget horror Yes Dont Look in the Basement could very well be the American Beauty of Grade Z trash
This is such a fun and funny movie Highly entertaining at all angles It features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts We got; the judge the Sargent the kid the creepy old lady the slut the clown And unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesnt have any locks and is understaffed So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous We also learn a lesson along the way never give your patient an ax! br br This was before Cukkos Nest AND surpasses it At least on the fun level It even has its sweet moments Love is pure Love is grace Love is strength You love me your love is pure youll always love me Now who could resist that? Nuts are humans too Just a few loose wires Be a little careful or youll get an ax in the back! Children at play Hehebr br The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine All the characters in this film are tremendously well played And I really did find them funny No HILARIOUS! They may even give you dirty thoughts of how you can take advantage of them Or how they can take advantage of youbr br This is actually a very smart movie There is a brilliant twist ending I must say I expected this to be a good but never expected THIS It is horrific The court has made its decision You are no longer in control! I love it The ending is so SO perfect youll shed a tearbr br I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this I will never forget it now It is not just a cult it is a cult CLASSIC Whatever you do Dont Look In The Basement !!!
Nurse Charlotte Beale(the lovely Rosie Holotik)has arrived to Dr Stephens clinic for the insane prepared for a new job What she doesnt expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal judge Oliver W Cameron(in a running gag anytime he confronts a situation out of his control he retreats to repeating his name) That doctor is Geraldine Masters(Annabelle Weenick)who isnt sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment After a long discussion about the position(which is quite an awkward scene as the two debate about Beales being sent a letter by Stephens getting a job at the clinic with Masters often reminding her that he is no longer in charge)Masters agrees to let her work in the nursing position but the good Doctor may not be who she seemsbr br The assortment of loonies includes Sam(Bill McGee)a simple-minded child-man who was Stephens last victim of lobotomy Jennifer(Harryette Warren)a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she wallows at Masters heel like a puppy Danny(Jessie Kirby)a trouble-making annoyance often trying to steal the fake baby of disturbed Harriet(Camilla Carr) Allyson(Betty Chandler)a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and hops at any man she sees & Sergeant Jaffee(Hugh Feagin)your typical case of soldier who hasnt escaped the madness of warbr br The film shows Masters unorthodox methods of running the clinic with allowing the patients to roam free with the doors to all rooms without locks calling into questionand not to mention the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite just chopping Dr Stephens with an axe And what exactly happened to Dr Stephens? Ah habr br Tacky 70s drive-in trash is a lot of fun if you are into a warped brand of cinema Im attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejects because of their unpredictable natureyou just never know what the hell might happen especially in this case where they are allowed to roam often unattended Some consider the low budget a liability but in the case of this film I think it enhances the experience With the cheap photography and weak production values(being shot for peanuts in a run down house in some awful location)it seems creepier and I felt like a voyeur peering into insanity through a camera lens on the outside looking in
If anyone ever assembles a compendium on modern American horror that is truly worth its salt there will have to be an entry for SF Brownriggs ubiquetous exercize in Asylum Horror Every time I watch this movie I am impressed by the complete economy of the film from the compact totally self-contained plot with a puzzling beginning and an all too horrible ending the engaging performances by what was essentially a group of non-professional actors and a prevading sense of dread and claustrophobia that effectively consumes the narrarive with a certain inevitability which is all the more terrifying because the viewers know what is going on long before the hero[es] with the only question being when are they going to wake up & smell the coffee?br br Shot on a dental floss budget in Brownriggs native Texas at an old palatial manor that nicely serves as the setting for a private sanitorium DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is another intriguing twist on the good old Edgar Allan Poe tome about inmates taking over the asylum just before an otherwise normal outsider unwittingly joins the ranks without realizing until it is far too late that not all is what it seems they are totally cut off & beyond any outside help and inevitably find their own sanity questioned as the madness spins out of control -- The Original STAR TREK TV series had a go at this with their WHOM GODS DESTROY episode from 1968 Juan Moctezuma gave the proceedings a peyote fueled Mexican psychedelic trip in DR TARRS TORTURE DUNGEON in 1972 and tangentially related is Fernando Di Leos ASYLUM EROTICASLAUGHTER HOTEL which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an ending that can only be defined as Splatter Cinema -- Brownrigg may not have seen or been thinking of SLAUGHTER HOTEL but he sure came up with some similar ideasbr br Legaliciuos former Playboy Playmate Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale RN in Clinical Psychology who has just left her nice job as a supervisor at a major hospital to travel way out into the middle of some god forsaken waste right out of a Peckinpah movie to work with a Dr Stevens at his private sanitorium Dr Stevens has pioneered a new form of therapy based upon basically encouraging the emotionally & psychologically scarred to face their inner obsessions bring them to the surface and hopefully rid the patients of whatever has fried their sense of reasoning Nice idea but arming a 6ft 250 pound utterly insane man with an axe and telling him to pound out his aggression AND THEN TURNING YOUR BACK ON HIM probably isnt the smartest idea and Dr Stevens is dispatched before Ms Holotik even appears onscreen with a good whack to the lower portion of his skullbr br This event leaves the sanitorium effectively in the hands of one Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Weenick who also served as the script supervisor & production manager] a woman of startlingly professional demeanor who quickly defuses the situation with the help of Sam the films wonderfully unlikely hero a lobotomized African American boheomouth played by an actor named Bill McGhee who was sadly robbed of a supporting Oscar nomination for his turn as a mass of muscle with the brain of an 8 year old boy Sams one wish is to have someone help him put his prized toy boat in the water and his continual asking of the various female cast members to do so [and his nonstop consumption of chocolate popsicles] as SOME kind of underlying theme though we will avoid such here because the kids might still be up There is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients but Ill leave the details of that to your discoverybr br Ms Holotik arrives just as Dr Stevens has been effectively laid to rest and is quickly won over by the snappy professionalism of Ms Masters who reluctantly allows the leggy young nurse to stay on in spite of the tragedy that has just happened oh TWENTY MINUTES AGO which you must admit was rather sporting of her Holotiks Nurse Beale begins to demonstrate symptoms of not being the sharpest meat cleaver in the drawer however when informed that she shares living quarters with a bunch of maniacs and there are no locks on the doors & doesnt trudge off for the nearest Ace Hardware Store to pick up a hasp and padlock to secure herself and we are treated to a couple of truly creepy scenes where some of the inmates sneak into her room & do stuff like smell her hair try to kill her with butcher knives and caress her neck with axe heads But thats all a part of working in such a radical psychiatric health care environment Ms Masters informs her and she goes about her oddly defined rounds that consist of wearing as leg defining a nurse outfit as you can find in a 42nd Street fetish boutique and getting to know the inmatesbr br Allysson is a obsessive compulsive nymphomaniac with homicidal tendancies who likes to take off her shirt & provide the film with some T & A between fits of histrionics;

Jennifer is a Phish fan who couldnt score a ticket to the New Years Eve Show and went insane & likes to scarf down nembutols and other barbituates when nobody is looking and likewise has hidden homicidal tendancies linked to her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron is apparently a homicidal pervert who became obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to chop things up with axes; Ms Callingham is an aged poet who serves as a sort of soothsaying old hag from MACBETH before the cat gets her tongue; and Danny is an insane idiot who was included in the cast as the random element that the plot cannot control and whos antics serve as the real catalyst for the series of tragedies & murders that ultimately take place in this dark old creepy house in the middle of nowherebr br The house itself is a wonderful set with a threadbare early 1970s decor that is remarkable in its unremarkableness with a fantastic use of color achieved by subtle ambient lighting The house is a series of hallways and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors twisting confined stairways secreted closets and passageways leading to the different larger areas and of course the basement mentioned in the title -- visited only once but boy it sure proves to be a doozy! I love the frosted old freezer where Sam keeps his stash of popsicles the utterly plain exteriors that remind me of a summer home our family used to visit every year & force us to swelter in the heat: Everyone is covered with beads of persperation and looks exhausted and even the ever cheerful Sam at one point begins to suspect that bad things are happening though he cannot understand what it all means and Rosie H is too firm in her belief of her profession to even suspect what has really happened and while Ms Holotiks limitations of an actress may have diminished the effectiveness of her Big Revelation scene shes a great screamer when all Hell starts to break loose and Brownrigg indulged of some nice camera shots of her in various suggestive poses or stages of undress that show off what a pretty lady she is without exposing anything more than her contract stipulated Too bad!br br The real show stealer is Sam however and fans of what I have been taught to refer to as Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed by the rather shocking finale and there is something moving about how Sam runs to the protection of his friend and brutally kills everyone within arms reach in a matter of seconds that either suggests he was one mean motha before his lobotomy or the film is CUT In any event you wont be prepared for the ending the first time you see it even though you as the viewer know what the score is long before anyone else in the film has put it all togetherbr br Except for one person: Rhea MacAdams uproariously stereotyped old coot Mrs Callingham [who seems to be inspired by the Donald Sutherland Old Woman character from the Michael Reeves 1964 Christopher Lee film CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD in addition to a rather nasty death by round spike to the eye] who not only predicts the future but has the films most laugh out loud amusing bit of dialogue while on a walk in the garden with Ms Holotik that runs something like this --br br Its really beautiful out here Do you get out much Mrs Callingham? asks Holotik to which the old woman repliesbr br Its YOU who needs to get outbr br Hilarious and one of those things you gotta kind of see for yourself to get DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is available on at least a half dozen bargain bin codefree DVD releases by companies like Brentwood Home Video Diamond Entertainment VCI and Platinum Disc Corps HORROR CLASSICS series; I kind of like Alpha Videos sexily gorgeously decorated $6 release from 2003:br br Dig through those bargain bins!

Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there She is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor Is Dr Masters all she seems to be?br br DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me The acting is excellent my favorite performance being by Betty Chandler as Allyson the nymphomaniac The chills just jump right off the screen You probably wont have to say Its only a movie its only a movie it isnt that scary but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre which I do It is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed AXE is another cheap film that is looked down upon Maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesnt have excellent effects andor isnt considered a classic doesnt have a chance with an audience But I think that after people see this movie they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish
Youll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land Its not so much of a horror show but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients Scream is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive-in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors Notice the judge whos about to put on the ax from behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r!!! Not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness but when you get a chance remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady: Get out! Get out! And never ever come back! Dont you wish you havent looked in the basement?
If you love drive-in cheeze from the early 70s you will just love this oneHow could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum? You cant!

I was unsure what to expect from driving lessons- unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked All the way through the music acting and scenery were absolutely stunning Julie Walters as always gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie and Rupert Grint equally as goodgave a fantastic performance as the romantic Benbr br Right from the beginning I was forced into involuntary cringes bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend Evie A very controversial story probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long timebr br Highly recommend to anyone seeking a good British film and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself
I had to get this movie since it didnt come to where I live I waited patiently and it was worth the wait I totally fell in love with this movie The chemistry between Walters and Grint you could see since they also worked together on the Harry Potter moviesThe woman who plays his overbearing righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is I think she did a great job playing the role I only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it LOL but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down (snickers) I totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch Rent this movie I do have to say that Rupert really did a great job and its nice to see that hes doing movies outside of Harry Pottereven though I totally love him as Ron Weasley The whole cast did a great job and I hope Rupert continues to act outside of Harry Potter to broaden his skill!
I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a local rental store Having just watched the latest Harry Potter installment I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work Reading the description on back about an overzealous evangelical Christian do-gooder and identifying as an evangelical Christian myself I thought Ooohthis should be interesting And so it was I found Mr Brocks story beautiful in both words and images; and sadly enough all too familiar The contrast he drew between Bens parents interpretations of what it means to be a Christian was a poignant commentary on how Christians view themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them On the one hand we have Bens mom stating Whatever happens behind these walls Ben were Gods ambassadors We show the world a smiling face On the other hand is Bens dad discussing truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film At the end of his monologue he states The more a person parades their Christianity for the benefit of others the less I am inclined to trust the Christianity they claim God tells us true faith is the freedom to choose truth Now how you express that the way the manner the means at your disposal these things are of no consequence be you Christian or atheist unless in your heart you are true If only our churches were full of Christians who ascribed to this latter definition of what it means to be a follower of Jesus rather than the former What a difference that would make! As a Christian and a psychologist I would want an imperfect yet authentic faith over a perfectly polished image any day What a tragedy  to feel like I always need to play a role when really I just need to rest in the freedom of being completely who God made me to be I think Mr Brock provides a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom in Christ looks like I recommend this film for anyone who desires a fresh look at faith
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoymentRupert Grint played the part marvelously and has a general knack for the acting business The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot and was a character one could almost instantly loathe This reminded me in a way of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood Not by means of actual content of the film but the premises and overall tone to the film itself Driving Lessons is a coming of age story which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother the lack of freedom and the discovery of oneself
I thought it was going to be a lousy movie honestly I mean Rupert Grint RON acting in a movie different from Harry Potter was actually really difficult to picture it But as the movie started it showed that this guy does have talent I mean is the best actor of the HP trio for reference have you seen Emma Watson trying to act? Or what about Daniels acting? Both lack experience even though they have acted in a million Harry Potter movies Ben his character is a very shy boy incapable of showing his true feelings about everything his despise about his over ruling mom and the resentful anger towards his father who is unable to step up and confront his unfaithful wife Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! Her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past while she tries to remember Shakespearian sonnets is absolutely wonderful! Also it appears that many youth is wasted in religious nonsense acts
This movie is a great film The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age The movie goes on about how Ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself Ben then meets Evie who he makes a very special bond with The two take a journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and Evie share This is the movie that you watch by yourself or with someone else No matter what you will all feel what Ben goes through in the movie It is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as Bens Lessons
I being a fan of Rupert Grint rented this film a few months ago I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors It was entertaining and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most well known character of Ron Weasley His subtle portrayal of Ben and everyone elses great acting made this film very likablebr br Ben a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother is looking for a job He finds one and becomes the I guess you could call assistant to Evie a retired actress At first it is just a way for him to earn some money But after a while he and Evie seem to develop a friendship Evie helps Ben break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself and in the end they both seem to need each otherbr br Whether you are a fan of Rupert Grint or not this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors
Id heard about this movie but didnt see it until my daughter who saw it on a flight to Australia told me it was a great movie I was interested in seeing whether Rupert Grint away from Harry Potter was showing the promise you see in the Potter movies I wasnt disappointed Hes become a fine actor showing a range in Driving Lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own and others esteem Going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging-actress employer its obvious that hes ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage But the jewel of this movie was Julie Walters Id seen her previously in the Potter movies Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls and loved her In Driving Lessons as she does lines from poetry and Shakespeare I was awed by her timing command of the language and body language Im hoping it was make-upcostuming as she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis though no mention of it is made in the movie-- as a nurse I can say that she did this perfectly portraying a woman on the brink of old-age but clinging to the sparkling past that she reveled in This is one of the best movies Ive seen in a long time and I wish Id seen it in a theatre first-- but I doubt it ever played anywhere here in Albuquerque We miss out on so many of these types of movies here
I really only watched this movie because it had Rupert Grint in it (who I knew as Ron from the Harry Potter movies) I had never really appreciated Rupert as an actor until this movie I loved the entire film Rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious quirky movie I think the movie could have been fine without the sex but it worked somehow I cant wait to see more of Ruperts films in the future Julie Walters also did an amazing job In the Harry Potter movies she has a very small role so I didnt quite know what to expect from her either But she was wonderful as Dame Evie The part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious Overall an amazing movie
Ben Marshall a teen ager from a religious background is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother Laura She suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household In fact the family has taken a widower to board with them Robert Marshall the father is a pastor at the local church; hed much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his churchbr br The job Ben applies is with an older actress Evie Walton who wants him to do things for her around the house Dame Evie as she calls herself is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not that great In fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but shed rather forget about it Evie who is a compulsive liar tells Ben shes dying only to forget it conveniently later on when she comes clean to the boy br br Ben is obviously in awe of the larger than life personality of his employer He has been taking driving lessons Evie asks him to take a camping trip which he does against his better judgment He knows that it will provoke his mothers fury Not content with that Evie decides to go on to Edinburgh where she has been invited to read at an arts festival It is this trip that solidifies their bond Ben gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic Bryonybr br When Ben gets back everything crumbles at home His mother who has been having an affair with a parishioner decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has been having an affair with Ben and Evies relationship survives the test of time He also begins to see his own father in a different light br br Jeremy Brock the writer of Driving Lessons and other memorable English films takes his first directorial job with this engaging comedy The mixture of show business and religion loyalty and friendship are explored in his screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies We have seen the similar situation before as in Billy Elliott where Julie Walters plays a nurturing role with a younger man We had read the film was based on Mr Brocks own experience while working Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young br br Julie Walters who plays Evie Walton is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie She always delivers Ms Walters is a welcome presence in any film she appears and she does wonders with her fake dame Laura Linney a luminous player herself doesnt quite get our sympathy with her icy mother Rupert Grint famous for his Harry Potters movies plays Ben the young man who sees in Evie a kind soul Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines
lovely i just love the movie i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor his expressions are great spectacular the movie was excellent Julie Walters it was perfect too I think that Rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love Rupert have a beautiful smile a beautiful voice and a wonderful accent i think that the movie was great and was great see Rupert in another thing but harry potter and its a very good actor so it deserves that and more he just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an Oscar academy award there are some actors that do not act very well but have a Oscar anyway it does not matter but he is perfect brilliant and beautiful
DRIVING LESSONS is a little film that sneaks up on you What at first seems to be a bit of fluffy nonsense comedy British style is at its base a very fine story about coming of age and the needs for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly Writer Jeremy Brock (Mrs Brown Charlotte Gray The Last King of Scotland) here directs his own screenplay and the result is a cohesive progressively involving tale filled with fascinating and diverse characters each performed by sterling actorsbr br Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint standing firmly on his own as a developing actor post Harry Potter series) is a quiet plain little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching Vicar father (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive rigid evangelical do-gooder mother (Laura Linney) in a home where needy people such as the murderous cross-dressing Mr Fincham (Jim Norton) take precedence over family matters: the mother is by the way having an affair with priest Peter (Oliver Milburn) using Ben as her cover! Sad Ben is among other things attempting to learn to drive a car His mother is a poor teacher and decides he needs professional lessons AND needs to get a job to help pay for poor Mr Finchams needs Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters) an elderly has-been actress who is as zany as any character ever created She hires Ben and the fireworks begin Through a series of incidents including a camping trip Evie demands they take the two learn lifes lessons missing from each others natures: Ben learns self respect and self confidence and Evie finds a true friend who will allow her to drop her stagy facade and be the dear human being she has been hidingbr br Julie Walters always offering the finest skills of acting in every character she creates finds a role like no other here: she is outlandishly wild and lovable Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age Ben The chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film Harold and Maude Laura Linney is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire And the supporting cast is a panorama of fine characterizations This film is a delightful surprise and one sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and acting - and message!

After seeing the Harry Potter movies Ive been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; yet weve been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the JK Rowling series Mainly instead of a trio the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on Daniel and Emma being that theyre the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving Rupert dead-end No matter every actor has a time to shine and Ruperts light hits him for once in this moviebr br Driving Lessons is called the Harold and Maude of this generation with Rupert Grint playing the role of Ben Marshall a young British lad who lives with his domineering mother (Laura Linney) and a wimp of a vicar (priest) father for which he wants a job in the summer but cant find work while at the same time taking his driving tests (and failing) and writing poetry for a young girl who doesnt have any interest in himbr br Ben seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady He takes the job and realizes that hes in for a fun of surprises as Evie (Julie Walters Ruperts mother in the Harry Potter series) an out-of-work actress who is also a poet giving Ben the run for his money They bond where and tell each other secrets along with Evie acting like a child and getting into mischief where she drags Ben along for a country road trip From their not only does Ben drive all the way from Britain to Scotland since Evie needs to recite at a local library but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man in which Ben starts becoming a manbr br There is mishap and at the same time rejoice with Ben and Evie along with saying that I was very pleased about the film when it came out in theaters and I was impressed with Rupert Grints acting especially if he showed the rest of the world that even though he brings a bit of Ron Weasley within Ben Marshall theres no stopping the actor on his brilliant performance
Ive felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him So even though I had never heard of this film before when it appeared in my cable TV listings I immediately switched to that channel I am so happy that I did! br br Ive read from other reviewers that they dont generally like coming of age stories; I on the other hand quite do I am one of those who is always coming of age; I have been since I was 12 Im 52 now and I will probably continue until Im 92 Coming of age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day brings The suddenness of the realization the magnitude of it sometimes throws us into disarray If we try to shelter our delicate selves from that then yes I can see how the coming of age can end But if we simply dust ourselves off and settle into the new direction weve discovered then were all of a sudden on a new path and were just as alive as we were yesterday only stronger brighter and I daresay more interesting br br So thats what this movie was about This was a coming of age story all the way round; young Ben his father Father Robert and certainly Dame Evie all went through a marvelous transformation In fact so too did Mr Fincham didnt he?! All did I suspect except in fact the mother in spite of her enormous opportunity so to do provided by the events of the end of the film One is left with the feeling that she will continue on exactly the same path shes been on only with perhaps a different supporting castbr br So an excellent film that could not possibly have been made in America which is utterly depressing to think about but thank God we have a steady supply of films made elsewhere that we occasionally get to see I really heartily recommend this film so long as you dont mind cringing through those parts of it that are all too familiar to us all and grinning through all the rest of it
A beautiful film One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed Made me think about death but not fear it think about life but not hide from it A movie that gave both love for all I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell A movie that made me think of love and all that I have lost but no sadness graced my eyes for some strange reason relief A child of two worlds god and theater And a good bit of wine and irony! I most highly recommend br br When The S Hits The Fan Get A Tent Oh and we should all go camping Every day
Sweet entertaining tale of a young 17 12 year old boy controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and withdrawn father and how he finds himself through his work with a retired eccentric and tragic actress Very well acted especially by Julie Walters Rupert Grint plays the role of the teenage boy well showing his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter series of films Laura Linney plays his ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption so theres no room to like her at all But the film is a very entertaining film made well by the British in the style of the likes of Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls
Loved this movie what a hoot Rupert and Julie are great together with Rupert being almost poker faced against Julies animation which worked well Laura did a good job as the overbearing motherJulie of course is marvellous as usual While this movie will keep you laughing most of the time it also has a poignant side to it as it unravels the secrets in the lives of the main characters Interesting that it was entitled Driving Lessons as this might lead you to believe this is the main feature of the movie which directly it is not though it certainly could be seen as Ben finally being in the driving seat in his own life Like most things that are funny in life there is always the sad side and there are some moving moments in this movie Very enjoyable movie and well worth watching
I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot It was very watchable and very funny Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch Bens character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potterbr br Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Bens over protective mother the only thing they went wrong with is by making her tooVillain-y Bens father was also an interesting contrast to his mother and in the end he is quite honourable too The only character i wasnt keen on was Bryony she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thoughtbr br Overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch one of my favourite films of the year easily
Driving Lessons sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on when Grints character comes into contact with Evee (Walters) a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego Grint betrays his overpowering and over-Christian mother (Linney) and goes off travelling with Evee to Scotland to accompany her on a trip to participate in a Poetry reading something she claims could be her last due to an illnessbr br Grints portrayal of a caged youngster brainwashed by an overbearing and even hypocritical mother is the masterpiece of this film His portrayal of a downtrodden teen in search of his true morals and happiness is captivating to watch unfold throughout The film is sharply shot and well paced with very few moments leaving you tired an achievement particularly considering the nature of the plot Walters really grabs hold of her character with both hands and successfully brings the audience to her side of things emphasising Linneys ironic immorality throughout Her role in Driving Lessons is enjoyable and memorable in every sensebr br The plot develops nicely leaving the audience cheering on Grint as he chases back to Evees place during his lunch break during his stint at a local bookshop to apologise for his wrongdoings The values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag in a very consistent way The overbearing (and relieving) main idea being that religion doesnt lead to happiness and certainly doesnt lead to moralitybr br The audience are left sympathising with the radical but lovable Evee with her and Grint making an irresistible partnership on the big screen transferred directly from their debut in the Harry Potter series Charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must-see this Christmas
I wasnt expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face Julie Walters Rupert Grint and Laura Linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas with words He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward Each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter 75% of the time The film satisfies all and I hope that soon it might be released in all US theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities It is a MUST see!
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival Rupert Grint shows he can act past Harry Potter Laura Linney is amazing as the overbearing mother Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton with a mouth worse than a sailor I hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it This film is not only about Driving Lessons but life lessons Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life Its an amazing film from an amazing director whose taken his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see and everyone who can should
Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films Mrs Brown and Charlotte Gray Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring Academy Award Nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and from the Harry Potter series Rupert Grint The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint) a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney) After his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever free-spirited and heavy on the bottle retired actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters) The pair embarks upon wonderful adventures from camping to walks around the block to the simple conversations about life Challenging the domineering mother as well as each other along the way the two develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes both their livesbr br The comedic elements are flawless and precise especially coming from the British veteran Julie Walters Brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first time directors could only dream Directing comes naturally to Brock as he builds up stunning imagery that breaks the surfaces and plunges the viewer down into an overabundance of adoration and creation Even the subtle score by unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn accentuate the tone and manner Brock had no trouble in generatingbr br Laura Linney is always making her mark in films as she does as Laura The bossy and overbearing mother is at times unbearable and with Linney at the helm of it we are engulfed into that persona The complexity of her character couldnt have been more flawlessly portrayed by anyone else Rupert Grint breaks away from Ron Weasley and tries on someone new His performance is more responsive than loquacious but Grint gives us someone brand new to a child performance and the viewer gets to enjoy it But the standout is coming from Oscar nominated actress Julie Walters who gives Evie a life of her own Despite the role being clearly a leading one Walters fairs better in the supporting category where I believe she can simply take home the prize Evie is a mix of Clementine Kruczynski and Mrs Laura Henderson with her free spirit and lovable persona Hopefully her role will not go unnoticed this awards seasonbr br Driving Lessons isnt an out of this world experience but a fine enjoyable one that any viewer could just kick back and learn a little something about life love and friendship coming in the forms of the most beautiful colors and sizesbr br Grade: 
I cant disagree with a previous comment that Driving Lessons is more than a little twee but one mans indictment is anothers endorsement I suppose In my book this film succeeds on pure charm no small feat in itselfbr br I cant help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway Julie Walters Dame Evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress Though Evie hasnt had steady work in years its unclear the last time she visited reality if ever (think Edina from AbFab at 65 at one point she is even forced to come to grips with her kitsch-factor) Some may find her annoying but I think thats the point to emphasize just how much she pushes the reserved Bens (Rupert Grint) buttons to force him out of his shell Ben is equally isolated from reality living his whole life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother who Laura Linney manages to breath some life into despite being a fairly one-dimensional character (ye olde overbearing religious mom) I was rather impressed with Rupert Grint who I found to give a very honest and believable performance (not to mention sweet as all get-out) I cant think of many teen actors today for whom I can say thatbr br The heart of the movie is what happens when Ben and Evies worlds collide At first Ben is understandably tentative but also intrigued as Evie is essentially the exact opposite of everything hes ever known With the combination of Evies persistence and Bens helpful nature a genuine sweetness develops between them culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives Ben his first real taste of independencebr br The tone is consistently light even through a few brief melodramatic bits but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance a credit to the main actors All in all Id say that if youre willing to sit back and let yourself be charmed by some lovely performances Driving Lessons shouldnt disappoint However if cute is not in your movie vocabulary best to stay awaybr br One other minor note the soundtrack features the music of Sufjan Stevens prominently a nice touch
I saw this tonight with moderate expectations - if Tartan Films have picked up on something and are releasing it the thats generally a good sign however Im not normally a fan of Julie Walters generally disliking her comedy roles (sorry to any fans but its a personal thing - I just dont find her funny in comedy)br br This was magnificent though - a great performance by all but Grint and Walters are exceptional! Plenty of laughs plenty of pathos great timing and a wonderfully paced film - such a coming of age film wouldnt normally be something Id expect to like so much but I cant recommend this highly enough - and watch Rupert Grint as he matures into a fine fine actor
I went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine Ill admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy I was wrong Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions This one did exactly that The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying This movie was great and I suggest that you go see it before you judge
My boyfriend and I went to watch The GuardianAt first I didnt want to watch it but I loved the movie- It was definitely the best movie I have seen in sometimeThey portrayed the USCG very well it really showed me what they do and I think they should really be appreciated moreNot only did it teach but it was a really good movie The movie shows what the really do and how hard the job isI think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary It was a great movie all around I would suggest this movie for anyone to seeThe ending broke my heart but I know why he did it The storyline was great I give it 2 thumbs up I cried it was very emotional I would give it a 20 if I could!
My yardstick for measuring a movies watch-ability is if I get squirmy If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore the film is too long This movie did not even come close to being boring Predictable in some parts sure but never boringbr br All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated until the day your boat sinks that isbr br The movie was very enjoyable and fun Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesnt know when to quit However I was most impressed by Ashton Kutchers performance I have never liked him never watched any of his TV shows and always considered him an immature  well punk In this film he does a great job! He is well on his way to having leading-man status I think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something because about 23 of the way in the film stock turned very grainy the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place Also at the viewing were representatives from the movie looking for audience feedback - particularly on the parts of the film we didnt likebr br POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife Sela Ward packing her stuff up and moving out He says Maybe I should be the one to move out And she replies No you dont know where anything is in this house; I should be the one to go This doesnt make sense: If she knows the layout so well Costner is right he should be the one to leave
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this? I cant count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint I was reminded so often of other movies it became a big distraction One of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow One line by itself is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad riskbr br BUTbr br See The Movie! Despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever While borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard In fact youll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out Why? Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well I have never been a fan of Kutchers and I nearly gave up on him in The Guardian but he surfaced in good fashion Costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of Costners ability I dont think Mrs Robinson had anything to do with his successbr br The supporting cast all around played their parts well I had no problem with any of them in the end But some of these characters were used too muchbr br From here on out I can only nit-pick so I will save you the wear and tear Enjoy the movie the parts that work work well enough to keep your head above water Just dont expect a smooth ridebr br 7 of 10 but almost a 6
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see itbr br I was caught off guard with the high quality of the film I couldnt image Ashton Kutcher in a serious role but his performance truly exemplified his character This movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support unlike so many other movies It does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie but in this case I highly recommend that everyone see itbr br This films is Truly Exceptional!
I only went to see this movie because I have always liked Kevin Costner I felt that Ashton did a great job in the Butterfly Effect Unfortunately even though these two actors wereare capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here Some of the scenes were just not believable and didnt have enough story line supportbr br Though the movie claims influence from the hurricane Katrina aftermath there was very little (none) to that effect in the moviebr br Overall I liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspectivebr br The special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating Not sure Ill ever go deep sea fishing againbr br I expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presentedbr br Definitely a movie that couldve been seen on DVD
I was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre-release last night and though I wasnt expecting to actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part The rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living The weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes Im not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of An Officer and a Gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertastebr br Like I said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clichés
Our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed The Guardian Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake After seeing this movie you cant help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescuesbr br Even though this is a fictional movie it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U S Coast Guardbr br The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible You actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescuebr br I feel the movie could have been made without the Hollywood bar scene (when you see the movie you might agree) since the real Coast Guard does not condone such behavior br br Very entertaining very action packed definitely worth seeing Thank you U S Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers So Others May Live Id highly recommend this movie to everyone
Im a Petty Officer 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard There were only a few scenes that were far fetched The most far-fetched was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessels captain out of the engine room that would never happen Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances Second the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak) it looked more like a NASA command center we dont have any gear that hi-tech Third the Captain of the Airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases with like 10 people on watch In reality it would be an E-6 or E-7 as the SAR Controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist SAR Controller & a Radio Watchstander Otherwise the movie was dead on I think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the CG and their roles in search & rescue instead of just Aviation based rates Some of the scenes from A school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff I did and got in trouble for in my younger days
Ive seen this story before but my kids havent Boy with troubled past joins military faces his past falls in love and becomes a man The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and dont generate enough heat to melt butter he compliments Costner well I never really understood Sela Ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted Costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs But her presence on screen is a pleasure The two unaccredited stars of this movie are the Coast Guard and the Sea Both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie The movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships But it still works The rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact This movie earns the audience applause And the applause of my two sons
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film I would have told you it was great! However I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied After thinking a little about it I believe the problem was the pace of the ending I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow and then the ending developed very fast So I would say the ending left me disappointedbr br I thought that the characters were well developed Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! Also the different relationships between the characters seemed very real FurthermoreI thought that the different plot lines were well developed Overall it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing itbr br In conclusion: Good Characters Great Plot Poorly WrittenEdited Ending Still Go See It!!!
I was looking forward to The Guardian but when I walked into the theater I wasnt really in the mood for it at that particular time Its kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy itbr br Im not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit The trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld Plus despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect Im still not completely sold on him Something about the guy just annoys me Probably has to do with his simian featuresbr br It took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission and I was gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers orange face lift My concerns briefly bristled at Kutchers initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious Sunglasses a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin a smirk thatd make George Clooney proud? Yeah we get it I was totally ready to hate himbr br But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs br br Darn you ape man! Efficiently mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting The Guardian is easily a film that I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy You can quibble about its clichés predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness but none of that takes away from the entertainment valuebr br I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated groupbr br Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival And if all that isnt bad enough sometimes you cant save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who diesbr br Man who wants all that responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought Id have an Ashton KutcherKevin Costner movie to thank for the education? br br Not only does The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customersbr br THE GIST br br Moviegoers wanting an inside look at what its like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance I saw it for free but had I paid I wouldve felt I had gotten my moneys worth
I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theaterbr br We have all seen this plot line before (Top Gun GI Jane An Officer and a Gentleman) but a good script still works This story is basically about the training of a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines Kevin Costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader Ben Randall who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission The movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the Costner character and that of Jake Fischer played by Ashton Kutcher I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this partbr br There are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives However the use of humor the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching Ben Randall do his own thing as a trainer kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud gasp here and there and clap at the end as a tribute to the moviebr br We all had a good time (despite a couple of tough moments in the movie)and I think you will too
I work at a movie theater and every Thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next dayToday it was The Guardian I saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie Well turns out this movie was a lot more than I would have thought It was a great story first of all Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did amazing acting work in this film Being a big fan of That 70s Show I always found it hard thinking of Kutcher as anyone but Kelso despite the great acting he did in The Butterfly Effect but after seeing this movie I think I might be able to finally look at him as a serious actorbr br It was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the US Coast Guard
I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films While the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the films most unforgettable emotional moment The specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibilityto save lives at sea The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowingI havent seen such angry seas since The Perfect Storm Co-star Clancy Brown (HBOs Carnivale - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guards Kodiak Alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins The film wonderfully and finally gives long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; it had the audience applauding at the end
As others that have commented around the web Im a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard Having said that and being the skeptic I am I went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors There was some cheese but all in all not much and the film was pretty accuratebr br I watched the trailer again today After seeing the film yesterday Ive realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes This isnt the casebr br The movie is truly more characterstory driven than action The inner struggles both Costner and Kutcher are dealing with Kutchers is revealed further into than movie than Costners isbr br Of course there is a minor love story no surprise there But for the most part the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together and after some time help each other heal old woundsbr br As girlie as it sounds Costner and as much as I try not to like him Kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the moviebr br As critics have stated youve seen it all before Top Gun Officer and a Gentlemen etc But what movie hasnt been remade a million timesbr br I can recall only one F word being spoken and cant really recall any other languagebr br The movie is 2+ hours and for some may tend to get a little long towards the endbr br Youll laugh you may cry but I can honestly say it was worth the $4 I paidbr br I hope you enjoy the movie
I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines mindless plot and the kind of nauseous acting that made The Postman one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time But I was shocked Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions Not since Robin Hood have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in Butterfly Effect These two actors came into this film with a serious focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films Ive seen this year No its not an Oscar worthy movie Its not an epic or a profound social commentary film Rather its a story about a simple topic illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible Thats what I think good film-making is and I for one am throughly impressed by this work Bravo!
Brilliant and moving performances by Tom Courtenay and Peter Finch
The Dresser is perhaps the most refined of backstage films The film is brimming with wit and spirit for the most part provided by the energetic character of Norman (Tom Courtenay) Although his character is clearly gay and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (Albert Finney) that he assists the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it isbr br The gritty style of Peter Yates that worked so well in Bullitt is again on display and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence This is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious In the end The Dresser will bore many people silly but it will truly be a delight to those who love British cinemabr br 77 out of 10
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies My only quibble is that the director Peter Yates had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene but the performances were so great I forgive himbr br Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely marvelous; brilliant The script is great giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during World War II (and therefore what it was like in the 30s as well) Lots of great subtle touches lots of broad overplayed strokes all of it perfectly done Scene after scene just blows me away and then theres the heartbreaking climax
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our Community Cinema and it got an overall average score of 86 Wed 100% recommend it then for todays audiences especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen and can talk about it with others afterwards as our audience didbr br The sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding Of course Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars but everybody was thoroughly well cast For our afternoon audience the majority of whom are senior citizens the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non-techy use of camera and sound was a great influencebr br How delightful many said to see a really great film thats British: still not dated twenty years on: not full filled with blood & guts: not confusing because of bob-about-all-over-the-place camera shots and back and forth through time story lines: no seedy sex scenes Such views were even uttered by some who were younger
The Dresser is a small but absolutely wonderful film brilliantly acted by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay How in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major Academy Award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me but its nice to know the Academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while (of course they gave the award that year to Terms of Endearment-- after all they dont want to be accused of showing TOO much taste)br br Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of King Lear; Tom Courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights Its both hilarious and piteous to see Courtenays character showering Finneys with attention and affection only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed even up to the very bitter end Finney and Courtenay work wonders together and though Finney gets the showiest moments (he does get to recite Shakespeare after all) Courtenay is the heart and soul of the filmbr br Grade: A
What is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews I have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film While Courtenays character is evidently gay he is not the only one: the often talked about Mr Davenport-Scott is the other and the reason that he is never seen the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in England at the timebr br We can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled Norman Courtenays character: and we can also see in a passing remark by Oxenby the Edward Fox character the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved: the fear of association affects many of the characters and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it The abandonment of Courtenay at the end by Sir has been anticipated all the way through if this subtext is included: it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to The flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that Courtenay has to step into the footlights as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the mans inner tormentbr br So while the drama is of the decline of Finneys Sir a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the fatal flaw of Courtenays gayness and makes this a film about him as the title suggestsbr br The art direction pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time more distant than the eighties and in some ways even than the second world war The implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre; and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant for all its flaws

This is a movie that deserves another look--if you havent seen it for a while or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983) Based on a play by the same name it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring Shakespearean repertory company in England during World War II It deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young able bodied ones being taken for military service It also deals with his relationship with various members of his company especially with his dresser So far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth While tragic overall the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout The two male leads both received Oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama theater--especially Shakespeare or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity The backstage goings-on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers
This film has its detractors and Courtneys fey dresser may offend some folks (who frankly need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging poignant relevant Finney naturally is larger than life Courtney makes an ideal foil I thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads and Courtneys character provides plenty of dark humor The period is well captured the supporting cast well chosen This is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial I only wish it were out on DVD already(sigh)
Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser Of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre and I think you listen better in theatre; but on the screen we become more intimate were up-close more than we are in the theatre we witness subtle changes in expression we see better as well as listen Both the play and the movie are wondrous: moving intelligent illuminating--of the backstage story of the company of historical context of the two main characters and of the parallel characters in Lear itself If you cannot get to see it in a theatre (I dont imagine its produced much these days) then please do yourself a favor and get the video
A fantastic cinema experience I really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out There is nothing to add except that is a terrible shame that sir Albert Finney still isnt accepted by the AMPAS (American Academy) After roles in such films as Tom Jones Murder on the Orient Express Under the Volcano (to name only few - for these he was nominated for the Oscar) The Dresser is arguably his highlight yetbr br I know Oscars are just popularity contest but if Americans like British actors and actresses (and the Oscar goes to Jeremy Irons Daniel Day-Lewis Anthony Hopkins Emma Thompson Glenda Jackson etc - and they all deserved the award!) why they always left sir Finney with empty hands?br br On the other hand they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny) I dont know should I laugh or crybr br If you have seen the two leads in The Dresser you wont forget what is the art of acting Watch this film and enjoy! I recommend it to everyone who loves artbr br I give 910 for this excellent film (1 point missing for non-cinematic material after all it is just a theater)br br Note: My criteria is much stronger than this on IMDb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that shouldcould last forever)
br br What more can you ask for? A great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century two fine emotional performances by Courtney and Finney a realistic vision of war time london a great supporting cast This film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour sadness loss and fulfillment if you are in the theatre it is even more effective This is a true 10 on the rating scale !
The Dresser is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary Donald Wolfit) it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlightsbr br As Sir the overbearing actor and main focus of the play Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the blow winds  bit of King Lear or chatting to his faithful stage manager Madge (Eileen Atkins good as ever) about the old times As Norman his camp dresser Tom Courtenay gives a fabulous performance wiggling around at the beck and call of Lear collecting a bottle to go at the pub or bitchily disparaging the former Fool Mr Davenport-Scott (often mentioned but never seen!)br br In an engaging support cast theres Edward Fox as Oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead) Zena Walker as her Ladyship Lockwood West as the replacement Fool and many othersbr br This film has great energy bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins it is true but being so well-acted you dont notice Very well done indeed
I just watched The Dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years agobr br Its not a big movie and doesnt try to make a big splash but my God the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this moviebr br The Dresser is the story of Sir an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney) and his dresser Norman (Courtenay) sort of a valet putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II These are two men each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anywaybr br This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life Finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when theyre taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer Employer is really the wrong term to use though For although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couplebr br Yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are Finney Courtenay and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood That is not to say that there arent other fine performances most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have beenbr br Although it doesnt get talked about these days it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay Best Picture Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplaybr br I had remembered this as being a good movie but I wasnt prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then I encourage you to see The Dresser
LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fine stage play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen This brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors fine music brilliant editing superb direction by George C Wolfe and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory! Yes it is just that goodbr br The story is based on the authors life as the child Junior (Marcus Carl Franklin) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic Rachel Nanny Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson) a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the South from mental hospitals and from the streets to Lackawanna New York The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny The myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business: Terrence Howard Rosie Perez Mos Def the beautiful Carmen Ejogo Louis Gossett Jr Jeffrey Wright Ernie Hudson Charlayne Woodward Jimmy Smits Patricia Wettig Macy Gray Liev Schreiber Kathleen Chalfant Lou Myers Hill Harper - the list goes on and onbr br In the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism the history of desegregation the dynamics of drug abuse and violence the infectious joy of African American music contributions to our musical culture and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact S Epatha Merkerson is wholly submerged in this role a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos She offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an HBO movie she without a doubt would add the Oscar to place along side her Golden Globe awardbr br The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues jazz dancing and joy The production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story Highly Recommended almost Compulsory Viewing!

Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson) Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her but she could have just as easily been called Wonder Woman She epitomized strength will power confidence and resolve She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject Her tenants consisted of a lesbian a psychotic war veteran an amputee and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary Each successive event Rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly She wasnt a dictator devoid of compassion but in fact she was quite the opposite She displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herselfbr br Merkerson did a good job but I believe this role was right up her alley anyway The movie had an even keel never straying from Rachel There were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected Nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than Rachel herself
Lackawanna Blues is a touching story about Nanny a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need Its told from the viewpoint of a boy taken in by Nanny when his own mother isnt quite up to the taskbr br I have respect for this movie for three main reasons: 1) It is touching but not sappy Its told in a very real fashion without a lot of the aggravating Hollywood storytelling baggage And the ending is quite good (teary but not over-the-top)br br 2) Although its clearly an African-American film being set in the post-segregation black community of Lackawanna New York it doesnt wear its ethnicity on its sleeve The story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) surrounding their lives Its not preachy its simply goodbr br 3) It has a great soundtrack (cant beat old-school R&B and Chicago blues)br br Generally the acting is strong but not universally so Some of the performances simply dont hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray But considering it was a made-for-TV movie thats to be expectedbr br 8 out of 10 Imperfect but likable good film for a rainy day
Every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love A film where you see people you know portrayed on screen Its cinema very at its bestbr br Lackawanna Blues is that film Set in 1960s upstate New York the story surrounds a rock- solid woman who is the foundation for her community This based on a true story film is told from a child she accepted as her own This child Ruben Santiago-Hudson wrote the screenplaybr br Emmy winner S Epatha Merkerson stars as Nanny a woman who has wit drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home She does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover Bill Crosby played by the Oscar nominated Terrence Howard br br But make no mistake; see this film for the amazing performance of Merkerson who is brilliant in this role She encompasses a person we have all known and perhaps lovebr br Lackawanna Blues is already on DVD; be sure to pick it up at your local video story todaybr br Merkerson has already won an Emmy Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild for this rolebr br Howard has an Oscar nomination for his role in Hustle & Flow
LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining engrossing emotionally-charged HBO-TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a small role) This joyous motion picture experience is centered around Santiago-Hudsons childhood guardian Rachel Nanny Crosby a strong big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate New York during the 1950s Nanny was a one-woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks derelicts cripples drug addicts misfits and everyone else in town who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out The crux of the story revolves around Nannys relationship with young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin)a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so Nanny took him in S Epatha Merkeson who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of Lieutenant Van Buren on NBCs LAW & ORDER turns in a powerhouse performance as Nanny the neighborhood mother-figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award Merkeson is backed by an impressive all-star cast that includes Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as Nannys husband) Louis Gossett Jr Rosie Perez Jimmy Smits Delroy Lindo Macy Gray Michael K Williams Jeffrey Wright Henry Simmons Patricia Wettig Ernie Hudson Mos Def and Hill Harper as the adult Ruben Colorful and exciting beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels but if for no other reason is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by S Epatha Merkeson who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it
This is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times Ill go so far as to put it up there with Ray and The Aviator It is the story of a young bi-racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing Miss Rachael aka Nanny You will fall in love with Nanny a woman who gives all of herself to those around her S Epatha Merkerson brings the character to life beautifully and the other cast members are do the same If I were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles Id have to mention everyone in the entire cast br br The music in this film perfectly blends with the story almost dictates the way it goes And whats more this film is actually entertaining It wont bore you at all not even for a minute! br br I highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend an evening at home watching a very smart very entertaining quality film
S Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago Jr (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under the guardianship of Nanny The film gives a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture lifes ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film The supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def Macy Gray Terrence Dashon Howard Rosie Perez Louis Gossett Jr Liev Schreiber Jimmy Smits Ernie Hudson Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig Loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling But overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by Merkerson
Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lees Shes Gotta Have It I have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatementbr br Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed She was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again I first saw Macy Grays name in the credits and went ho-hum Her performance was so good I didnt even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through I am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in African-American culture that is very tastefully donebr br Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choicesbr br This is a worthy elegant presentation of African-American life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic You owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collectionbr br I highly recommend
Lackawana Blues An impressive HBO movie about a beautiful woman that made her house a home for several charactersTouchingaliveentrancing-a great mix of sound and story- based on a true story featuring an All-Star castA time capsule about br br you get the point and no I am not on the payola for the HBO crew- I would throw around more superlatives but I am about to go out  The extras on the DVD include a deleted scenea featurette and commentaryThe funniest part about the featurette was star lighting they used when interviewing exec producer Halle Berrybr br OK seriously - good times A
What a wonderful film filled with eccentric unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast The director also did a great job keeping the story held together getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect S Epatha in the lead role is great I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is and although I have enjoyed her on Law and Order this really shows what she can do with a filled out complex role Macy Gray is terrific Mos Def as usual wonderful Lou Gossett great Jimmy Smits terrific and doesnt try to pull focus because hes a star A true piece of ensemble acting br br Rent it enjoy it groove to it and treasure it Something special
This is one of those movies that you just dont want to end The characters are rich like a well woven tapestry Colorful costumes music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War A young man is taken in by a dynamic big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiencesbr br I couldnt believe this was a made for television film It was so well executed S Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as Nanny and she brings so much life to this role You want to be right there amongst her boardersbr br I enjoyed this film so much I bought the DVD
One of the bestLackawanna Bluesbr br Great moviegreat castgreat musicthis is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutesI will w3atch this one many times br br This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role You get the sense that youre really there taking all this in A great deal of care was given in the sets costumes and music of the period The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on but the steady performance of Ms Merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before weve had our fill of the wonderful misfits To single out anyone other than Nanny is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including:br br Jeffery Wright Jimmy Smits Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo But it is Marcus Franklin Macy Gray and Ms Merkerson that makes this a wonderful experiencebr br The movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards but it is without question one of the best movies youre going to see this year If you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally tug at your heart lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time then this is the movie for you Ive shown it to several friends and they all want my copy that says it all the movie is that good Check it out for yourselfbr br danceability-1 Amsterdam Holland
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people br br Its editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seenbr br The music really tied into the story which made the characters come to life The editing made the story more progressive and captivating br br I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast most notably S Epatha Merkersonsbr br I cant wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer Ruben Santiago-Hudson
Just a great soundtrack Really enjoyable music Outstanding cast great lead performance Worth watchingbr br Doesnt really explain what happened to the neighborhood You are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegratedbr br This movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wrightbr br The cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music food drink dancing gambling and sex
I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO It is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale I was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played Nanny She is an outstanding actress Of course my favorite actor is Terrance Howard He is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received Ebony magazine did do a nice article on him giving him some of his due propers Lakawanna Blue gave me a understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us They were from a similar town Philadelphia PA were they had to have their fun in the junt joints and such I also like to say that Mos Def is a incredible actor He has found his calling Ive seen him in several movies where he has played a variety of roles from thug to doctor and he has the stuff! Overall please put Lakawanna Blues on video for rental
Lackawanna Blues is and excellent movie The casting was perfect Every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played Their chemistry together was amazing The acting was superb I felt as if i knew the characters I could almost feel them They reminded me of people that I knew as a child growing up in the 50s and 60s Oh the memories!! My personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see I have watched this movie so many times that I can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them I cant even list my favorite part because I have SO MANY favorite parts Thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that I never see in this day and ageand that is Black people loving each other looking out for each other respecting each other caring about each other and doing all we can to help each other Gotta go now I have to go watch it again
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on It brings back happy times for me I grow up in a big city in the mid-west It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost The big mamas of day are under the age of 55 Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past The music was great in this movie I truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters I would have paid to see it As I viewed the movie for the second time I figured out who life this movie was about He did an superb job in writing and producing this film I guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you As soon as I can I will be obtaining a copy for my home use I alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than Thanks for such a great movie
Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy The film clearly supports it takes a village to raise a child and reminds of an important time in black history and culture I gained an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress Her character was a little crazy yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like Macys character S Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress Law & Order never showcased the depth of Epathas acting abilities like Lackawanna Blues I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhoodit was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane I truly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the DVD release to add to my collection
Fantastically written acted and produced! Loved seeing this gleaming talented cast -- every single one of them -- give a such great performance This movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart! Great storytelling!br br This is a great movie for Black History month Full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain -- with dignity and a belief in a better future It is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adulthood The next time youre in the company of a listening and observing child remember; show or he may be a writer-in-the-making!
This was absolutely one of the best movies Ive seen br br Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and backbr br I couldnt help but care about the characters Ms Merkerson will blow you away as will the young man playing the young leadbr br I also thought that the set design was top-rate The viewer is really placed inside each era as its presented br br The music is a blast too Nice selections to represent mood time and place The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs br br This is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings Take the time to watch it!
This is a must-see movie You will laugh you will cry and when its over youll wish there were more Well-written and compelling this movie draws you in and holds on tight The casting was perfect the characters purposeful and the performances outstanding Nanny is the standard to which all women should hold themselves: strong forgiving protective and never judgmental Nanny to me is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community If I were half the woman Nanny is I might consider myself to be doing okay I would have been devastated if Nanny had died at some point in the movie but since she didnt I will definitely buy this when it comes out on DVD I can only hope that the story continues and that Ruben goes back to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the town piece by piece and person by person
This movie was very good not great but very good It is based on a one man play by Ruben Santiago Hudsonyes he played most of the parts On paper it looks like stunt casting Yes lets round up all the black folks in Hollywood and put them in one movie Halle Berry even produced it The only name I didnt see was Oprahs thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a Hallmark movie Instead this movie was not some sentimental mess It was moving but not phony the characters came and went with the exception of her husband Pauline and the writer in question The movie revolved around the universe of Nanny Mrs Bill Crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people Now being a jaded New Yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man Im thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going Getting folks jobs and taking the medicarecaid checks But no she explains to Lou Gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time I think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded New Yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folks(g) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal(g) She almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes I can see why She is married to a neer do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her Terrence Howard was born to play these type of parts He was good but I would like to see him play something different Markerson who plays Nanny is also very good But for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright Where is this mans Oscar? He already won a Emmy and a Tony He was in Shaft and he stole the movie I did not even know who he was in this movie He is a chameleon never the same I never seen him play a bad part yet This was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry I re-winded the scene few times one time because I didnt know who he was His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent I have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff But she is so good here I actually know people who act just like her So it was very real to me Macy Grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good I was very happy that they did not kill Nanny off I thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people There are women like that in most of our lives People we might know or even lived with Thank god for them I do not know how they do it all of the time I have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever I am feeling selfishly sorry for myself I call her and she always puts me in a good mood THis movie is a tribute to all of those people I only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man Paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on HBOs The Wire Omar Rosie Perezs character and Richard the lesbian and Delroy Lindos one arm man he was mesmerizing in another small role
This was a great movie Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child The performances by S Eptath was outstanding Mos Def and his singing was off the hook Had to do a double take when I saw that was Rosie Perez there But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching All the different stories they had was amazing And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence I can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone Cant wait for it to come out on DVD It would be a welcome addition to any movie library
No blood no sex (though it oozes passion) no special effects but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when youre not really looking and grabs your attention br br Great acting great sets great music beautiful storyline If only there were a lot more movies made like this one!br br The sets move us through time and make us feel like we were therebr br The acting appears like real life and elevates us to the level of awareness of Nanny to whom no-one is a lost cause least of all the inhabitants of her own Halfway house br br Best of all its a true story of misfits learning to fit in I was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie! Could we all spend some time in Nannys house?
Lackawanna Bluesis so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s A culture of joy and sadness specific to working class Blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture The characters of Santiago-Hudsons play depicted Black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of loveloyalty and honor Although the characters moved away from those values at times they did not deny the importance of the values Instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters without judgment that passed through the life of nanny The central characters were strong and believable the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a by-gone era Pre-integration urban life was a time of sensory intoxication sight soundand smell that could almost be experienced by watching the drama Lackawanna Blues unfold I will watch it again and again
I gave this film my rare 10 starsbr br When I first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line I almost turned it off I am very glad I didntbr br This is a character driven film a true story which revolves mainly around the life of Rachel Nanny Crosby a strong beautiful (inside and out)Black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of Lackawannabr br Highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of Nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for African Americans in the 1950s prior to integration and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the Black communitybr br In addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast there is some fine singing and dancing from that era
Superb editing outstanding acting especially by Epatha Merkerson and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack This film reaches back to the 40s to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic ladybr br The actor portraying the young Terrence Howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town The audience laughed cried and erupted in applause for the film and its director br br Soon to be shown on HBO (Feb 7 I believe) - fire up the TIVO and enjoy a great story!
I always felt that Ms Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills Familiar to millions as the Lt on Law and Order she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases always in a supporting role HBOs Lackawanna Blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as Nanny successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration But the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna New York a suburb of Buffalobr br The story could be set in any major African-American community of the 50s and 60s from Atlantas Sweet Auburn to New Yorks Harlem But the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at Nannys boarding house The story revolves around Nannys relationships with all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the business (I purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black except for Jimmy Smits of course) I recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day
The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S Ephata Merkerson Ms Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny the woman who believes in doing good no matter to whom with no strings attached This actress clearly shows a range that is amazingbr br Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes placebr br Of course none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadnt written his wonderful play Working with Mr Wolf perhaps the best theater director of this generation they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of Ms Crosby when his own parents are not around to take care of him Ms Crosby becomes the adoring mother of little Ruben; in a way he represents her reward for having lost her own daughterbr br Unfortunately there is no time to develop some of the characters as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between Nanny and the young Ruben played with such charm by the young Marcus Carl Franklin who is a natural The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive as it doesnt clarify or justify what one is seeing Frankly just by watching the interaction of the players is self explanatorybr br In the background there is always music No matter what hard times these people are going through but Nannys house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that erabr br Aside from Ms Merkerson other notable performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard one of the rising stars of the moment Mos Def Jeffrey Wright Marcy Gray Louis Gossett JrDelroy Lindo Rosie Perez Carmen Ejogo Jimmy Smits and the restbr br Ms S Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience In Lackawanna Blues she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma
The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel Nanny Crosby who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy Ruben the narrator of the film Based upon the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s br br The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse Nannys ability to take fragments and make them whole affects everyone within her sphere An especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband telling him firmly If you ever touch that child again were going to dance! As delivered by actress S Epatha Merkerson that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger temper is frozen in his tracks br br From start to finish Merkerson delivers a commanding presence Her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home This was a touching heartfelt film with a wonderful cast As played by Merkerson the character of Nanny simply radiates love This is a film experience that I will remember for a long time to come
Fun entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) falling in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson) while trying to get secrets from him For some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970--I cant see why Its beautifully shot has wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting aerial dogfights Also it has Andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--Whistling in the Dark The movie does have problems Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows Their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry Still they turn in OK performances The film is a little long (even in the 105 min directors cut I saw) and gets way too dark and serious at the end Still worth catching Try seeing the directors cutthe other one runs half an hour longer!
It really is a great film (after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny) Julie is as usual wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket London on its release However Julies non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not Two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years But Darling Lilijust like STAR! deserves much more public appreciation
Darling Lili is a mixture of Perfection and Magic! The Stars; Julie Andrews & Rock Hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried Its full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you The brilliance of the Director; Blake Edwards is shown to be at his best He was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen!br br The blend of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film The Film opened with Julie Andrews singing Whistling Away In The Dark and closed with the same Song by Andrewsbr br For A Film Of This Excellence To Have Been Such A Failure When It Was Released Is A Total Shockbr br As It Is: InspirationalPurelyInspirational! ~One Of Andrews Most Memorable Lines In This Film!
I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Directors Cut version I was very surprised that it was rated G How did they get bedroom scenes a seduction story line two strip tease acts and warshootingblood into a G rating? Weird I would rate it PG-13br br Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie It was a beautiful showcase of Andrews voice and talent The acting was great The storyline was a little weak leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue There were too many no talking just walking scenes for me I would have liked to see the the relationship between Julie and Rock blossom so that the intense love would be more believable
I first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an LP recording of the soundtrack I liked it so well I went back to see it several timescannot understand why it was considered a flop Julie Andrews was lovely in this film her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful!br br The film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy-handed they were still fun br br I recently found I could get a copy in DVD form and ordered itI was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the DVD I ordered
This Blake Edwards film isnt too sure whether it wants to be a comedy a drama or a musical No matter the sheer presence of Julie Andrews is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film Rock Hudson looks tired but hes is more than fine as Julies romantic interest Authentic World War I cars and planes add to the appeal Overall the film is very entertaining The DVD release is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original release Supposedly this is the only version that Edwards would allow; but Turner Classic Movies has shown the complete (theatrical release) version recently Recommended
Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie  musical The opening song by Ms Andrews Whistling Away the Dark will always be in the back roads of my mind The plot line during World War I is great and suspenseful one If you are a romantic you will love this movie This is a movie that I always enjoy to see again and again
i found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful henry mancici music didnt lull me julie andrews was excellant and i sure dont understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes me happy at the end to have everybody singing and i do like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor
This movie is certainly well-constructed beginning and ending in the dark with focus on Lili Smith Schmidt Julie Andrewsinitially the singing angel later the notorious spybr br Its beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently While it was dismissed by critics in the 70s as overblown cinema vulgaris and lacking in structure (among others) time has proven them wrong Blake Edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical qualitybr br The film soars and swirls (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates One must just buy into the premise that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong Overlooking the tepid chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson one must believe that these are lovers - who in all innocence fall for each other And in the end love is far more important than winning wars And so is maintaining innocencebr br There is a lot of understated acting and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comediesbr br There are wonderful comedic elements (foreshadowing the French goons in VictorVictoria) interesting diplomatic asides (reminding me of The Tamarind Seed seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of good-willbr br Suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away Julie Andrews belting out of war songs and the haunting Whistling Away the Dark are reason enough to turn the TV on just for the soundtrack And the striptease number like the Jenny number in Star! works br br This film has like a good champagne aged well Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible The same applies to transferring the laser disk of Star! to DVD These are both interesting pieces of Julie Andrews meticulous and then underrated works
I always loved this film The musicstory and the action I especially love the opening and closing of the film The music stayed with me throughout the years The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical Blake Edwards Slaptick is his forte after all Julies singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen The sets and the scenes are wonderful The characters are appealing I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julies singing to them I wish she sang to me in Vietnam I also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the WWI musicI was glad when the DVD arrived Now I can whistle in the dark watching it again and again
Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this isnt bad! In fact its quite entertaining Actually its a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a stars personaebr br To break Julies goody two shoes mold she plays a German SpyEnglish Musical Hall Actress She subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie SOB and play a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby Blake Edwards directionbr br The movie is admittedly problematic It is hard to feel for her character because shes a German Spy We want to love Julie but shes on the wrong side of the law Probably this is why this movie flopped Julie as a German Spy? Our Mary Poppins? our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German Spy?br br The romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere But never mind its a musical and it has Jullie Oh and did I mention hunky Rock Hudson is in it too?br br Julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss Great WW 1 Songs and nice tunes by Mancinibr br Yes the film has plot holes and at times doesnt seem logical For example why is Julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the Germans when a minute ago she was spying for them br br But on another note who cares? The musical numbers are fun and exciting The costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish The cinematography quite on the markbr br It has the annoying idiot detectives that Blake Edwards puts in all his movies (Yawn)br br But it has Julie- trying desperately to change her image (You can imagine dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: Blake we need to change my image br br Blake: I Will make you a German Spy then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie They wont recognize you It will be the death of Maria Von Trappbr br Fascinating study on changing an image Wonderful Julie A must see for musical comedy buffs Much more entertaining than Star!
Yes I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! Julie Andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the Whistling in the Dark production number The sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that Rock Hudson has been seeing a dancingcall girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you gigglebr br I only wish that this film could be found in video or DVD as I would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!
Darling Lili is fantastic! Its by far one my favorite films! It certainly didnt deserve the poor reviews it received Julie Andrews playing the title role of Lili Smith (Schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie She is entrancing and spectacular! As Julie Andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far I was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is This movie is justgreat (Im running out of adjectives!) its magnificent marvellous amazing funny terribly romantic sad and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews!And to her husband director Blake Edwards Oh yeah Rock Hudson was ok too :)br br Julie Andrews is the beautiful and well-loved singer Lili Smith Rock Hudson portrays Major Larabee who quickly falls for Lili and she with him But their affair was not coincedental There meeting was planned by the German Government (Im not sure if thats exactly what youd call them but you get the point) because the warm happy singing entertainer Lili is actually a German Spy Lili is told to seduce Major LArabee in order to get information of the new Top Secret Opertaion (later know as Crepe Suzette) Though Lili is on a solemn mission she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee) for real making her original quest challenging But Lili pulls through and completes er task after she finds out something that is not really true about Bill The ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out If anything youll thoroughly enjoy this movie I most certainly did!!!!!!!!br br 
This often maligned movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards Julie Andrews Henry Mancini or Hollywood musicals Other writers have commented on the shifts in tone the confusion of plot etc but the film has many things to recommend it The score is one of Henry Mancinis best (and he has written many wonderful ones) several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews Julies performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes (she is at her absolutely loveliest here) the on-location shots are breath-taking and there are some funny Inspector Clouseau-type sight gags to boot Rock Hudson basically phoned in his performance but he is passably good A real curiosity item in that it was the last major film Julie did for about 10 years and in many ways is a precursor to VictorVictoria It is lovely to look at and listen to When will it be available on DVD??? When it is I for one would like both versions--the longer and shorter directors cut Since it was lampooned in SOB they would make a great two-pack!
I suppose I like this film as well as any I know; it is not perfect but under the title The Americanization of Lily this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more and still loved by those who recognized its special Blake Edwards-produced spirit of gentleness clever humor and solid narrative The improbably but delightful story-line follows Lili Smith a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passing as Smith is helping her Uncle who is patriotic too for Germany but neither cruel nor political merely opportunistic Lilis target is William Larrabee a charismatic US squadron leader who can supply her valuable information The plot thickens comes when Lili falls in love with Larrabee has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes She gets jealous of a rival for Larrabees affections then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business The logical end of the film comes when after the terrible WWI has ended as she sings the theme song of the film Wishing in a darkened theater one by one the members of Larrabees squadron appear including her lover himself indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even Uncle Kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of Its a Long To Tipperraree to indicate all is well with the world again This is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of John Goldfarb fame; and it is a delightful narrative Larrabees squadron including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film; and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic both in its scope and realization Credit must go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creations Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for sets Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production design Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score and to Russell Harlan for his shining cinematography In the beautiful footage the principal actors are Julie Andrews as Lili Rock Hudson as Larrabee Keremy Kemp outstanding as Lilis Uncle Kurt Michael Witney Lance Percival as the inebriate pilot gorgeous Gloria Paul as Lilis stripteasing rival and many other fine actors in smaller parts It is hard to say enough nice things about the pace or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by Edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization This comedy also helps prepare the way for Lilis conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing This is a rare sense-of-life film about Lilis Americanization her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen It is haunting I find and beautiful in many ways I consider it to be Blake Edwardsmasterpiece of directing; and under the title The Americanization of Lili I believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard I know
Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson while on an assignment for Germanybr br The songs are beautiful The two are well-paired Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays br br A half-German half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in WW I Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs br br I loved the film Some will say its a chick-flick but so what Its wonderful br br Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped It may not be up to Rocks performance in Pillow Talk Magnificent Obsession or Giantbr br Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland and authentic WW I -type planes were used in the film Scenery for England and France is absolutely gorgeous
Robert McKimsons Acrobatty Bunny is one of the directors finest shorts Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimsons dreadful Big Top Bunny Acrobatty Bunny is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion Acrobatty Bunny is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at Theres a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion In a brilliant Disney parody he hollers Pinocchio down the lions throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come There are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lions cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of Laugh Clown Laugh which as a child I used to impersonate regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name Ive never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but Acrobatty Bunny breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst McKimsons best
Once again Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people This time the traveling circus put a lions cage right over the rabbits hole So Bugs has to come out of the hole and face Nero (thats the name of the lion) which he does in his usual hilarious style After a slow and rocky beginning to the cart it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious Nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for Bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one if still shorn of a classic This animated short can be found on Disk 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3br br My Grade: A-
The good news is that the circus is in town The bad news is thats right over Bugs Bunnys underground home He wakes up as his place shakes like an earthquake hit it when workers pound stakes into the ground and elephants stomp by etcbr br To be more specific the lions cage is place exactly over Bugs hole The lion sniffs food and by process of elimination figures out its a rabbit Bugs curious what all the racket is about winds his way through the tunnel and winds up in the lions mouthbr br Ill say for thing for BB: he is totally fearless at least in this cartoon and at least for 30 seconds When he comes to his senses he runs like crazy and we get a lion-versus-a rabbit battle the rest of the way Once again Bugs faces dumb opponent one he calls Nero but lion is fierce and Bugs will need all his wits and somewhat-fake bravado to fend off this beastbr br About half the gags are stupid and the other half funny but always fast-moving colorful and good enough to recommend I mean its not everyday you can see a lion on a trapeze or doing a hula dance!
A savage undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it At first he thinks Bugs Bunnys home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes Bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground there he meets with Bugs his next trainer br br If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on you should watch this cartoon Director Bob McKimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour br br The signature scenes include:br br 1 the look of Bugs Bunnys home cross-referencing to Donald Duck with the BB name acronym on the headboard of Bugss bed br br 2 Bugs Bunnys short journey with the mine hoist climbing up to the ground floor br br 3 When Nero the Lion calls his friend the Elephant for help Bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the Elephant; since the Elephant needed a broom to outpower that toy mouse he uses Nero as a broom! br br 4 Bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make-up and the practical clown jokes that he makes br br 5 the trapeze scene while Nero chasing after Bugs br br 6 the famous Human Cannonball scene after which Nero the Lion starts dancing Hawaiian Hulabr br The magic moments which keep Acrobatty Bunny fresh at all times in our memory:br br 1 When Bugs comes out of his bunny hole he thinks hes in the Pinocchio tale; and starts acting to save Pinocchio out of the giant whales stomach br br 2 When the Lion roars to scare him Bugs replies back to him with roaringbr br 3 Bugs arguing with the Lion for hes making so much noise then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than him br br 4 Wearing rubber heels at the circus Bugs starts to bounce like toy rabbits and causes Nero to bounce! br br Those are the 10 main reasons that keeps Acrobatty Bunny as a Bugs Bunny classic and can be found in the Bugs Bunny Classics MGMUA Video (1989)
When the circus comes to town and places the lions cage directly over Bugs Bunnys home Bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid Despite the title Acrobatty Bunny its only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics But even leading up to that its quite funny what Bugs does to escape getting eaten; somehow he always manages to use the other characters weakness against him and then pull any convenient object out of thin air! Bugs later ended up in the circus in Big Top Bunny I liked this one better as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know that it was during the Cold War but still) I recommend this onebr br And with the end we can affirm that itll never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon
Channel zapping one night I just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning It tells the sad story of an adopted child Adam whose mother left him after birth The movie takes us through his childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from Adams past I will not reveal more but it is a very in-depth movie and will intrigue you for sure This was one of Jimmy Smits best roles in my opinion
A very good film focusing on a very important issue Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable If more families saw this film perhaps more children would not end up like Adam Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles ever This is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs This is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the United States today There are children struggling with this world wide The really important point here is that it all could have been prevented More people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously It is well done with important messages handled in a graceful way
This was a excellent movie I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching this movie was more than word can explain I also purchased the book and it was great I would like to have a copy for my own use and so I can have my sons teachers watch it alsoI would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where I could purchase it Thank You Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with childrenadults with special abilitys This movie should be shown again on TV The team of doctors that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy His special Ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he can have or that he can borrowbr br Thank You
This movie was everything but boring It deals with reality To the people who think this movie was boring open your eyes to the real problems in our society Our children are dying The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselorand i deal with these problems every day People of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse It destroys families hurts people and leads to serious brain damageall kinds of health problems and death It is all preventable This movie should be shown in every high-school in the world If anyone owns this movie and wants to sell it or sell me a copy please e-mail me at: Ottenbreit2@netzeronet thank you
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV I only wish I could contact someone to see it again I married a man with three children and two had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome I didnt realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties My step-son is now 35 and thank the Lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother We speak every month to Rehab patients with alcohol and drug addictions and this sharing has truly made monumental changes in their behaviors and endeavors to start out a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol Please please let me know how I can get a copy VHS or DVD of this movie or when they will show the movie again on TV If you have not been in these shoes you probably could never understand its value Thank you so very much
This story focuses on the birth defect known as FAS or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome a disease diagnosed too often among Native Americans In spite of the down-beat nature of this drama the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well This is arguably Smits best performance
This is a piece of cinematic beauty and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived breathed and ate everything Maurice Richard The book does this as well as the short and Im glad that in all the time I did spend studying French in high school this was required reading in both languagesbr br I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier narrate this story His molasses-thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story The animation was good as well very surrealist which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream fancying over better days gone bybr br Again as a symbol of culture quebecoise this is unsurpassed One can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove This whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be Canadian and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots Im from Ontario and this film made me fall in love with Quebec Maurice Richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs
I throughly enjoyed this short even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan br br Director Sheldon Cohen and Narrator Roch Carrier captured all of the boys emotions perfectly From the feelings he had for his hero Maurice Rocket Richard to the excitement anticipation and hope of getting a new Montreal Canadiens sweater soon to the look of horror on his face when he got his sweater from his mother; A Toronto Maple Leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful (in his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs sweater; Not the rouge bleu and blanc of the Montreal Canadiens with Richards number nine like his old sweater And worst of all his Mum made him wear this Maple Leafs sweater out of the house You could envision and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got therebr br I was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts Ive seenbr br 
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50s60s and 70s My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986 I have been a Canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life on a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 117 All hockey fans should see this as I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Centre in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place Watch this film with your family it is a great movie I also recommend the book in both French and English Go Habs Go
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec Thats because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades As an American the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees If you are a fan then they are the greatest and winningest team in history If you are not a fan then they are Satans team!! Well at least thats how it was as I grew up in Washington DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys So I am pretty sure when this film was shown up North that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction--their national sport AND the closest thing they have to a national team in the NHLbr br Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for the Canadians AND Maurice the Rocket Richard However when his mother accidentally buys him a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and forces him to wear it I knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy This ability to connect to the character--even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film The way the other kids treated him and his conversation with God at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film Very clever and memorable
A boy who adores Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens receives much to his horror a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the mail I recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey but nearly everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the TorontoMontreal rivalry Highly entertaining amusing and accurate
This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who as a child specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your Mom or Dad (or both) that it didnt matter as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a Witness Protection Program in order to avoid ridicule For those US residents who dont get the horror because you dont follow hockey its like a Dallas Cowboy fan getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey It isnt pretty For our European friends think of two great rival football (soccer to us) clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other Ouch!!! NFB of C outdid themselves here!br br Une hommage du Maurice Rocket Richard merci M Richard
Animated shorts just dont get much better than this wonderful Canadian film This short feature is dripping with Canadian references and so this film will probably be appreciated by Canadians most of all But the basic story is universal and it is told lovingly by writer Roch Carrier It is a hilarious story that I have known for quite sometime and I was recently fortunate enough to see it again so I simply HAD to write a hearty recommendation for it This is a masterpiece and a must-see whether or not you are Canadian
Having been raised in Canada I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC I have seen it numerous times at many ages in my life and each time the reactions are the same It is a joyous bittersweet beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart I am sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere digging aroundbr br Every kid growing up can relate to the situation and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols The scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the Eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless I havent seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short hasbr br Sure I am a Montreal habs fan and that makes my appreciation for it more special But in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey and the memories of your family telling you that you should be greatful for what you get even if it isnt exactly what you wanted And oh yeah the animation is beautiful too ;)br br Rating 10 out of 10
Well I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin on this animated short He loves it and claimed it was hilarious I enjoyed it but didnt see any humor He doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story Living right across the border from Canada I have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in Buffalobut I didnt think much of this cartoon Oh it was interesting and I know what would happen if you wore a Toronto jersey up in the Quebec area - disaster! That especially holds true in the glory years of Les Canadians However that doesnt make the story funny br br Back in the 1950s everyone in the Quebec provinces idolized the Montreal Canadians and their star player Maurice Richard and everyone wanted to be like him When his mother orders a new sweater it has the Toronto Maple Leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it When he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies Whats so funny about that? I could see the same thing happening to a kid in Boston who is Red Sox die-hard and his mom gets him Yankees shirt! Horrors! You couldnt wear it and vice-versabr br Maybe to someone who doesnt follow sports at all like Maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a fact of life or any bit-time sports fan and his favorite team It was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laughbr br The art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid The French Canadian accent was good too This movie was part of the DVD Leonard Maltins Animation Favorites From The National Film Board Of Canada
This short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose undiplomatic criticism extends into his everyday life When he learns why thats not a good idea we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that hes been lecturing on
This movie with all its complexity and subtlety makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I have ever seen The topics it addresses are ugly cynical and at times even macabre but the film remains beautiful in its language artful with its camera angles and gorgeous in its style skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories Tobias Wolffbr br Not wishing to spoil anything of the movie I wont go into any details other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself It takes pride in what it does and does it well It shows the most important memories of life all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling: unexpected bliss This movie of its own volition has created in me the same feelings the main character (Tom Noonan) felt when words transformed his very existence and that is one impressive feat
The finest short Ive ever seen Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened due to the density of insight it offers Theres irony in that comment and little merit The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly I might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect This is a short for people who read for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty A beautiful short film FWIW: I was pleased at the Picasso reference since I once believed that Picasso was just another art whore with little talent; like I assume most people - until the day I saw some drawings he made when he was 12 Picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime I understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for
This is a very very odd filmone that is so odd its best you just see it for yourself The film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance Additionally he seems tired and bored with the monotony of lifebr br Later in the film he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head Oddly this is only half-way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life This is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professors novels--one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say thembr br See this weird film--its amazingly compelling and not like anything Ive ever seen before
Although Bullet In The Brain is without question superior amongst short films it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film And it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot But after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place There is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit - it seems like theres almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast A slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit Despite these complaints there is no denying that Bullet In The Brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short and even full length films The makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and Hollywood action
means take up and read which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous filmbr br Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolffs 1995 New Yorker article of the same name The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing sound design cinematography and directing are truly inspired The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle clever and make the film cinematically more dynamic Its lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it againbr br Watch out for this young directorhes going places
br br Her Excellency Madam Shabana Azmi has worked in countless movies over life time I think best is yet to comebr br Fire is okbr br But still good days are yet to comebr br Hopefully in Water I will be able see her betterbr br Thanks and Regardsbr br PS: India doesnt have a director to make best use of her
For a moment lets put aside the cultural aspects of this movie even if it is a very important side of it and lets look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish husbands They have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope If each one of these two women had been alone imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept They found each other and they fell in love That this love was against all the social religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant They loved each other found relief in each other that was sufficient The reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept suffer even and then they can go on with their lives their life Very nice
As well as being a portrayal of a lesbian love story FIRE is also a comic satire of middle-class (?) Indian culture I find this is a quality which is little appreciated about the movie These two genres (ie deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do but Mehta (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection The servant Jatins behaviour the familys treatment of him the bedridden grandmothers constant inescapable presence Ashoks obsession with a swamis teachings: coming from a culture much like Indias these are things I can immediately identify as being typical They have been crying out to be pointed out and ridiculed While developing her primary subject matter Mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully In fact much of the humour in the film which provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues stem from this satire of the seemingly ordinary The film flows from the comic to the serious with great subteltybr br All in all brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compared to Sita of legend and coming out of Fire unscathed and therefore pure; the lifelong desire of the young Radha to see the ocean finally achieved when she gains freedom) Kudos to Shabana Azmi(Radha) the lighting crew and Deepa Mehta; their very un-Hollywood-like (and un-Bollywood-like!) talents made this movie special One criticism: the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me in that they did not flow into each other very wellbr br The verdict: 9 on 10 Nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned on my mind
Easily one of the best Indian films ever Granted thats not saying much(I made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching) But I can truly say that Fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films Ive seenbr br Beautiful because of its imagery The best example I can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads(Radha and Sita) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology Sita for example is the wife of the revered Lord Ram As legend goes Ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to prove her purity Sita in response cries and leaves him reuniting with her mother(the Earth) This story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 Indian women(Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi) The word Fire all of a sudden has many meanings - marriage tradition religion motherhood and probably a few others I didnt catchbr br Brilliant because of its social overtones Many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see Fire(eg my mom who actually loved it) Why? Because although Fire is an attack on tradition it is also an attack on tradition In other words that is its strength NOT its weakness Traditional conservative social mores(whether Indian or Canadian or American or whatever) are useless if they enslave you Gender roles and self-denial can both do thisbr br These are the things I took with me after seeing Fire Hats off to Deepa Mehta
The movie is really about choices In the oppressed state of affairs as seen in Fire where good women had to be obedient and do what was correct in the eyes of tradition there seemed few options for Radha and Sita However granted that it was not their only option What is life without desire Radha questions Ashok Yes its true that life provides us with a number of options but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors When your world is confined to a small Indian household being a dutiful daughter-in-law to a silent but observant still powerful matriarch a dutiful wife of 13 years to a man who has taken a vow of celibacy due to your not being able to have a child a man who only wants you lying next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires I felt the ladies had little choice but to find solace in each others company I guess the fact that so many women applauded Ms Mehtas work was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves An option to do what was perhaps unacceptable The lesbian scenes I felt was merely to put that point across Every scene in the movie from the first at the Taj Mahal to the last at the Mosque is etched in my mind How frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires To feel that you had to forgo the human touch to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you To have to suppress any desire you might have and to crave for the human touch What then is the meaning of our existence one wonders In the scene where Sita is crying alone in the room and Radha comes in to comfort her their lips accidentally brush against each others and it awakens a feeling in them Something they have both been deprived ofbr br Bravo to Ms Mehta in translating her vision so clearly I especially like the flashbacks to the young Radha trying to see for the ocean It is a metaphor for freedom Freedom to choose freedom to transport ourselves to places we would normally be unable to reach In those scenes it is gently told to us that her sense of duty has also been passed down from her mother who I assume lives within the rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage The movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by AR Rahman Since the film I have become ardent fans of the two lead actresses and the director I look forward to more of Ms Deepas future productions
The theme is controversial and the depiction of the hypocritical and sexually starved india is excellentNothing more to this filmThere is a lack of good dialogues(why was the movie in english??) There was lack of continuity and lack of passionemotion in the acting
Deepa Mehtas Fire is groundbreaking bold and artistic A masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative upper middle class Indian households this is a film no one should miss Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible AR Rahmans music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film Mehta uses Rahmans score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they look to each other for support This film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it Lesbianism is just a part of the film It is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning
For all that has been said about the subject matter and the controversy that surrounded it please do not overlook what I feel to be the most important part of the film: the salient struggles of everyone to keep their pride through their trials Whether dealing with self-imposed male braggadocio a sexual reawakening or even life itself everybody is human
Water (2005) the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehtas elemental trilogy has been finally completed almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element Fire (1996) which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel 1947: Earth (1998) Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch (1975) but it was her Canadian feature film about the life of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back in east her country by birthright Sam & Me (1991) Recognition internationally came in the way of Camilla (1994) starring Bridget Fonda along with the actress who in 1990 won an Oscar in Best Actress in a Leading Role category at the age of 80 paving the way for middle-aged actresses to still have hope for her portrayal of a stubborn old Jewish woman in Driving Miss Daisy (1989) late Jessica Tandy br br Camilla dealt with a friendship between two women from two other ends of the human lifespan a MayDecember friendship Camilla was Tandys last picture; she died the very same yearbr br International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial Fire which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist Having already explored friendship between two women in Camilla in Fire Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women Set in modern day India the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi it shows two brothers and their wives the elder brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy faithful to his guru of sexless existence The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) is having an extra marital affair with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon) Thus both the wives Shabana Azmi playing the elder brothers wife and Nandita Das the younger wife find themselves neglected in their own way One forced to lead a celibate life thanks to her husbands eccentricities and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex and nothing more Living in a world of in-laws and being the only two outsiders in the family having nobody else to confide in the two women fall in the arms of each other Thus comes the issue of lesbianism If there were an outside mans shoulder to cry on there most probably would have been chance for them to fall into the arms of a man but having no one else to confide in their need for each others support is quite obvious It does not necessarily state that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism it just happened to exist with regard to the two women in this context All in all the movie is excellent and delves far deeper than just two women rolling in bed The key focus isnt lesbianism in the movie but the plight of modern day neglected Indian wives even in the capital city the two female characters just happen to have a sexual relationship br br Two years later Deepa Mehtas second installment was the element of mother earth released in India by the name of 1947: Earthyet another excellent movie by a great director this time in the Hindi language unlike Fire which was made in the English language br br Now Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy despite a lot of problems having released the final installment recently Water No doubt it would be just as great as the other two
This was a bold movie to hit Indian cinemas when it was released The first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst Indian women The leading actress of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with Nandita Dasbr br The movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible The sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemasbr br Good acting by all the actors especially Nandita Das amidst criticism from the Indian public
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece Id recommend to buy this movie on DVD because its a movie you might want to watch more often than just once And trust me youd still find little meaningful details after watching it several timesbr br The characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced no black and white Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists there is also empathy for the other charactersbr br I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants dont belong or arent accepted they dont need to conform and dam their desires The other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness It fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires The mother in her still couldnt find the strength to destroy his myth She sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust-control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up? Both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband br br But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept Sitas desire A decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culturebr br Seems like it was easiest for the househelp to let his desires flow - since hes anyway damned by his culture - being at the bottom of the hierarchy Since there is anyway no respect and expectations might as well taste sin
It is more a subtle story of the fact that in Indian household how most decisions are taken by the man how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires not to give the woman pleasure And in such a type of scenario women invariably have two choices either to accept all this and take it into their own life which is usually the case or not accept this and try to mould things to satisfy themselves which makes a movie!br br Fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option which women choose for themselves no sacrifice not to serve anybody else rather a decision for their own good Somehow the whole idea of justifying lesbianism didnt find an acceptance in the Indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self-expression then the whole debate doesnt even arise
While the romance in this film is an important aspect it is largely about the role of responsibility and duty in modern Indian All of the major characters were well fleshed out and had their own inner life I recommend this strongly
one of best movies everFireit is not much about sociological description of India todayit is the mind blowing use of light that never stops never becomesnormaleven whenin this sense the movie is almost uniqueboth leads are of very good qualitythe origin of Das as a street performer are pretty obviousher performance is a superb cammeobut the use of the lightI have look at it and looked at it again and againstill mind blowing after agesnothing torrid in the storyrather pure way of facing the subjectin a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today a major art work is usually known as a gender filmFire can stand face to face with Dryers Jeanne D Arc or Ichikawas Biruma no Tategoto or some of the major Kurosawa movies just to name some Wish my input could help a little this movie to its deserved way to fame
I finally watched the third film in Mehtas trilogy: Fire To begin Id say that Water was the unquestionable masterpiece on all levels Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality Fire: there is so much going on in this film that Ill need a few more viewings to drink it all in The writing is superb the script creating friction that starts the entire process of heat from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships br br Mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced false and repressive about the great society from which she came from India is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change That she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of Water after having had the script cleared shows that there are still many taboo subjects which Indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face cannot examine or discuss them Worse if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues she faces death threats So as much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic tolerant society the facts are not always so Whereas Earth was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after Indian independence Fire and Water are pointing at personal social and religious issues which as I say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that an open artistic dialog is still many years away As I write this Water is scheduled to actually be shown in India later this year Ill believe it when I see it br br Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that I saw in A price above rubies Whether its arranged marriages (which it used to be like among Jews about 150 years ago or like it is among many modern Indians) they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women; or just plain loveless marriages However this is not the real issue Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire) I am no expert regarding either the secular or Hindu laws concerning divorce The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce)is almost as bad as the sad marriage In any case Mehtas film is a very moving powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny That all three of these films have made themselves felt in India as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset Mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack I admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough Superb disturbing provocative taboo shattering
There are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer Two women progressively find themselves ensnared in each others arms (as corny as the expression sounds that is exactly what happens) and fins that they cannot answer their own question as to what defines their relationship when their very own society has no name to what they are Deepa Mehtas somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy here linked by the theme of the elements and more symbolic than consuming Fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not make an appearance here since the women -- the older and more feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and the younger more masculine tempered Sita (Nandita Das) come to realize they share a lot more than common ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families As in WATER FIRE is deeply spiritual even if it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama (where WATER much like the weight of the word carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition) Even so its a very beautiful picture and a strong voice from a strong director
Now I do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all Indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians have concerning their women and sexuality I have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society (with women being murdered because the husbands family doesnt want them any more after his death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing) I also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter--even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in India a decade ago As a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie most Western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this filmbr br Although I am a male am not rabidly feminist and I am straight the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is NOT an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by Lesbians and man haters In fact I dont think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands Yes I use the word wicked and mean it as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouses sexuality In many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existencebr br One husband married a vivacious young woman Sita out of family obligation This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning Sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband However he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about Sita--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady To make matters worse he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies In their dead marriage sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way Sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met And unfortunately he could have cared lessbr br Another husband was married to a lady who was infertile (Radha) Oddly after initially trying to have children they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever! Its because this man has decided to become an ascetic (ie in Hinduism a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment) Now his wanting to do this was all well and good IF he was not already married and had obligations for his wife However being married this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care The closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him--as having her next to him helped teach himself to overcome the desires of the flesh This must have brought nothing but frustration to herbr br So youve got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs Eventually these needs bring these sister-in-laws together--at first just emotionally but later sexually as well The movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolationbr br Late in the film when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from Radhas enlightened husband--a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossiblebr br This is a very challenging and adult film While there is very little nudity the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids Very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady--as I said this is NOT a film to let your kids watch However for a mature audience this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to thinkbr br The film features good acting complex characters excellent writing lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some but which I found rewarding The only serious negative I cannot blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape This is because although the movie is in English the accents are quite strong at times and its not always easy to understand whats being said BUT and this is the worst part there are no closed or open captions--including them is a must for Western audiences If you do watch this film see if you can find it on DVD or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning--mine sure didntbr br By the way director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOODHollywood A consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and Westernism--with a strong emphasis on female characters Not surprisingly this West-thinking lady makes her home in Canada and is divorced--a truly unusual woman to say the least For a similar film that explores traditional culture meets Western culture try another Canadian gem EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN
Overall a well done movie There were the parts that made me wince and there were the parts that I threw my hands up at but I came away with something more than I gone in withbr br I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition Without spoiling it let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in Ramayana is way beyond what this movie stands for The Ramayana is an epic Not a 200 page book that puts down women in India The movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive Indian family While the basic tenets of the unwritten laws of the family tradition seem to be that of conservative India let me assure my reader that I (having lived in Delhi for 12 years) found entire parts that just did not ring those bells I mean some things and some actions are very true but some other stuff is just way off the mark Especially todaybr br Delhi is complicated India is complicated The director tries to simplify both And fails pretty miserably at thatbr br Why in English? Can you imagine a movie about American Indians in English Or the French speaking in English Seriously jarring Even the servant spoke in fluent accented English (albeit with a hint of colloquialisms in the language for believability)br br But the chemistry between the leads is palpable If you like it hot this is a movie for you I think that is the biggest saving grace - the development of a true real life love storybr br If this film was about Radha and Sita then it would have got full marks from me And in being about them it could have made a subtle statement But this movie goes out there to say this is what India is and this is what Indian society is like And in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt The dark secrets of India are not being revealed Just two girls are falling in love Just like it happens everywhere else
A stunningly well-made film with exceptional acting directing writing and photographybr br A newlywed finds married life not what she expected and starts to question her duty to herself versus her duty to society Together with her sister -in-law she makes some radical departures from conventional roles and mores
This was a great film in every sense of the word It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others the importance of status and face religious hypocrisy sexism the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity the binding concepts of duty and so on At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves The film is well-acted and genuine completely believable from beginning to end unlike most Bollywood flicks The main faults of the film as I saw it was first that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead-end marriages with no passion and no rewards This may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters but most people stuck in the same situation will not turn homosexual It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual -- when Radha does her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok she makes it quite clear that without desire she was dead and the implication was that if he had desired so he could have fulfilled her quite completely and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals -- they may seek comfort in others in the same position but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning -- quite the opposite Some people are bisexual it is true but most tend to be either hetero- or homosexual In the case of the ladies in the film both had insensitive jerks for husbands    if this had not been the case would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered? The film ignores this The other fault is the naming of the characters    the names Sita and Radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage (imagine a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named Jesus and another named Paul!) by using names associated with various Hindoo scriptures The film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion At any rate the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie It is indeed a very touching and powerful story -- the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre
This is my first Deepa Mehta film I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its Sita character presented as Nita I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not NitaSita Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta not her direction The characters big and small were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of Mazurskys An Unmarried Woman They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men And one cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him---carrying his invalid mother Biji He seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion br br Ms Mehta seems to fumble as a director (however compared to most Indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant) as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social milieu of India She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!) Yet her Radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field Compare her to Mrinal Sen Adoor Gopalakrishnan Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giants--given her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehtas film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space Kannada Malayalam and Bengali films have touched parallel themes in India but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoersbr br Ms Das Ms Azmi Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors (Mrinal Sens Khandar Gautam Ghoses Paar Benegals Ankur) a brilliance notably absent in this film Ms Das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability All in all the films strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema I am sure Ms Mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays
CONTAINS SPOILER INFORMATION Watch this directors other film Earth at some point Its a better film but this one isnt bad just differentbr br A rare feminist point of view from an Indian filmmaker Tradition rituals duty secrets and the portrayal of strict sex roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic film viewing experience All of the married characters lack the fire of the marriage bed with their respective spouses One husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual adultery by giving all of his love honor time and respect to his religious swami (guru) His wife is lonely and yearns for intimacy and tenderness which she eventually finds with her closeted lesbian sister-in-law who comes to live in their house with her unfaithful husband This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese mistress but was forced into marriage with a (unbeknownest to him) lesbian They only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginitybr br A servant lives in the house and he eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers Another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke However she uses a ringing bell to communicate her needs as well as her displeasure with the family members She lets them know through her bell or by pounding her fist that she knows exacly whats going on in the house and how much she disapprovesbr br In the end the truth about everybody comes out and the two female lovers end up running away together But not before there is an emotional scene between the swami-addicted husband and his formerly straight wife Her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die However we see the two women united in the very last scene of the moviebr br The writerdirector of this film challenges her cultures traditions but she shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture and gender We come to really care about the characters and we dont see them as stereotypes Each on surprises us with their humanity vulgarity tenderness anger and spirit
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the films plot details than I could What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense - emotionally visually editorially - just gorgeousbr br If you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of artbr br On a scale of 1 to 10 Id give it about an 875 The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece If you are in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then its a 10 I definitely think its a must-see but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall 875
Its worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film Three main female deities -- wise Sita nurturing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave Rama playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender -- are all alluded to Knowing the folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story In fact one folktale is enacted first on stage as part of a lesson in spirituality and then in the movies real life Fire speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewers awareness making it a deeply satisfying presentation This is the finest film ive seen in the past ten years; very highly recommended!
This intelligent moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkners novels)br br The characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume and seek for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them off altogether But as the story develops the two wives trapped in loveless marriages draw together Drawing on the strength of their friendship and love they give each other the courage to abandon their rolesbr br They have found that living within their traditions is no life at all it is a sort of living death: without passion without true connection to others without fulfillment Although they know there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom it is a price much less dear than the sacrifice called for by a comfortable predictable existencebr br The screenplay is wonderful the acting marvelous Near perfect!
The thing which makes Fire even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry is its touch of femininism and rebellion To my mind the very character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society The name of the movie and the scene when Radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of Hindu Mythologys Lord Ramas wife Sitas walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy as per the same narrative which appears in the film too The film could be a great inspiration for women particularly those in the subcontinent to search for their liberties and to attain control of their lives
A fairly interesting look at some characters from Indias burgeoning middle class Although India is rapidly modernizing her culture is not keeping up This film involves the patriarchal society where women are not yet truly free citizens A land of arranged marriages men who dally with mistresses with total impunity and women who are expected to tolerate all this will eventually come up short I was impressed with Nandita Das who was quite attractive and played her character with total earnestness But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood Her quiet beauty and low-key psychic suffering was excellent The lesbian subtext of this film was never particularly erotic and never titillating (Darn!) Worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures
This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition All this against a backdrop of an India which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values This film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front It is easy to see why Fire has caused riots in India but tragic nonetheless A true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world not just privileged westerners
SPOILER ALERT! Dont read on unless youre prepared for some spoilersbr br I think this film had a lot beneath its shell Besides the apparent connections with Oldboy (and Park-wooks other films) an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric physical actionbr br The main actor Kang-ho Song is terrific in the rôle of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally sang means blood in some languages - who truly loved Tae-ju played by OK-bin Kim Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in Badlands where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her fingerbr br Their relationship is one thing but the girls mother is entirely different While moving she is stiff one-dimensional and taut but paralysed she says all through not moving or through the wink of an eyebr br Park-wook has really really mastered his cinematography in this film and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catchbr br The music is quite stock using mostly strings to accompany the main thespians monoreaction; its a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is While he does very little and loses at that he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot While his love-interest says and does a lot her actions display very little thought behind it In my humble opinionbr br All in all a very disturbing film that is not made for action which isnt even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days; its magnificent and repellant at the same time
(This has been edited for space)br br Chan-wook Parks new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify Nominally a horror movie the central character is a vampire the film actually has elements of comedy theology melodrama cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body) romance and few other things as well Its a film that has almost too much on its mind The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature in this case Emile Zolas Thérèse Raquin Its an odd mix that doesnt always gel but none the less has an incredible power Here it is almost 24 hours since I saw the film at Lincoln Center (with a post film discussion by the director) and I find my cage is increasingly rattled Its not so much what happens is bothersome its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospectbr br The plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood (its not explained) he actually survives Hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick Unfortunately all is not well The priest finds that he needs blood to survive He also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire and its no not possible for him to go out during the day Things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family The priest some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend From there it all goes sidewaysbr br An ever changing film this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was Its a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else Its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of waysbr br The film has enough going on that one could and people probably will write books discussing the filmbr br The two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance The vampire part of the tale is brilliant There is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the affliction that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside Sitting in the theater last night I found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked I think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life Its contrasted with what happens later it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isnt going to work Its not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys rather its something else I personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible (The sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool) The romance is also wonderfully handled Sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done but its the other stuff the looks the talk the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special I love the looks the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected and the mad passion of possible consummation This is one of the great screen romances of all time It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love (and lust) If youve ever loved deeply Im guessing youll find some part of your hear on screen I know I did The statement I just wanted to spend eternity with you has a sad poignancy to it Its both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion The tragic romance will break your heart br br I wont lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great Its not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great (especially the actors who I have unjustly failed to hail as amazing) the whole doesnt always come together The various genres thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other Frequently I was wondering where the film was going I hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlesslybr br I liked the film a great deal I loved the pieces more than the film as a whole Its been pinging around in my head since I saw it and Im guessing that it will do so for several days more Like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward One of the meatiest and most filling films of the year
The cinematography is the films shining feature Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera Every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen Every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own I hope theres a Blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic Its rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology Park used for his vision Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight He doesnt however have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirrorbr br Although Ive never seen the film I couldnt help but feel like this was Chan-wook Parks version of Twilight The entire middle portion of the film is devoted to Sang-hyeons and Tae-Joos love for one another It felt like the adult version of Twilight really Theres a lot of blood nudity sex and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure Maybe its the Chan-Wook Park fanboy in me but I honestly feel like I can guarantee that this is the better film of the two The psychological aspect that I love about Parks previous films is in Thirst as well Thats a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite The soundtracks to Parks films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove Thirst is no exception While the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlesslybr br The middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film Its weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and its hard to imagine Thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut Nevertheless it is my one nitpick of the filmbr br Chan-wook Park bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark psychological twist on it Parks films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: great writing beautiful cinematography a solid cast some sort of psychological twist thatll mess with your head and a memorable ending Thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on DVD (and eventually Blu-ray hopefully)
I wasnt expecting much because of the harsh reviews and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result Softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films in my opinion allowed the narrative to take the focus Though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace I felt like many of the other things were not For example:br br how his powers were often revealed through interaction with herbr br the very strong and well acted love scenesbr br the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even morebr br Their strong differences of what it means to be vampire created by their prior life experiencesbr br the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the moviebr br Ive heard and read several things about tricks used in other films Of course However i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I feel that he does this well I dont need a director to use new tricks I prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately which i feel is the case with this film br br I recommend it
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique brilliant and very twisted at a minimum Well anything that isnt Im a Cyborg at least Parks newest film titled Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama  yes that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin Park creates a uniquely Korean and uniquely Park vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop Park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like Oldboy or even that of Lady Vengeance Heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience Thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room It crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of Park Chan-wook filmbr br Check out the rest of our review at wwwthefilmstagecom
Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully shot Thirst - laughter Although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didnt know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals br br It helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful and that I was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she becamebr br I read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong I didnt think so In fact the last scenes moving and hilarious (I mean the brown shoes) by turns were among the best in the film
They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughtsbr br That was not the case when I watched Bakjwi under the American title Thirst Now playing at select theaters near you Seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details There WILL be blood in this film and you WILL try to look awaybr br For rest of review please visit http:without-terebiblogspotcom200908thirst-aka-bakjwihtml Thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above
The definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living Bakjwi nearly nails this concept on the head minus the cliché of pointy fangs and neck biting Being an R rated movie I knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires Which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to Twilight Having viewed Chan-wook Parks preceding Oldboy I had very high expectations of Bakjwibr br I anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our anti-hero known as Priest Sang-hyeon and was very impressed by his performance as a holy-man who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying his thirst as a vampire (SPOILER) After the initial premise of him surviving the defective blood transfusion he starts to crave blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability The screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition He starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons The oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative Tae-joo is very riveting as they are played by The Hosts Kanh-ho Song and actress OK-vin Kim The special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesnt offer anything new in the ways of stunts and CGI it didnt impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise The story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own Korean style br br There arent many negatives I can say about Bakjwi Sometimes I ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long The movie was long to begin with On the same token vampires really dont have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with As mentioned before this movie is very tragic so dont expect anything hopeful while watching this br br Overall Bakjwi is delightfully dark morbid and original I strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of Twilight This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish Let The Right One In which is also a good movie
i hate vampire movies with that said this one was very interesting to me i do want to point out one thing tho bakjwi literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories you see count Dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva We also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many categorizes them to be exceptional As I watched the film I realized that the theme of bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to make the bat-vampire connectionbr br Duality of human nature = if you ever read aesops fables there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just cant seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage Mammals and birds find out what this bat has been doing and banish the bat out of their lands at the end of the storybr br the two contradicting sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex sang-hyuns blind priest friend sang-hyuns effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire tae-ju playing both sides her ordinary boring life vs her thrill seeking vampire adventure etc (wont ruin too much u have to watch the film) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance sex violence religion dark-comedytragedy vengeance you name it!br br i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long but this film is very fresh and new something that i havent seen b4 yet I wouldnt say this is CW Parks best work but it is mos def the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing!
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do If you havent seen Oldboy(or the sympathy trilogy for that matter) you are missing out on some of the best films made this century But im not here to talk about them Im here to talk about thirstbr br This movie is not what you would expect Yes it is a vampire movie but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl I wont get into the synopsis(you can read that above) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception With some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting he sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene The movie does start a bit slow but I felt this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters Once things start moving along it almost never lets up until the credits roll Thirst is predominantly a love story but not in the same sense that you would think the relationship between the lead characters is very intense but at the same time almost disturbing Chan-wook Park is no stranger to controversy as we know and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy The end scene is by far the most powerful in the movie and perhaps one of the best conclusions to a film I have seenbr br Overall this is an exceptional film that I feel all movie buffs should see It is an exciting(and admittedly different) take on the world of vampires and the romance is far from sappy or boring This movie is gritty selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways Obviously it is not for everyone but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested See it Do not hesitate
Im the first to recognize that Chan-wook Parks Thirst is exceptionally well made but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time Sang-hyeon(Kang-ho Song)is a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously Instead of legitimately dying Hyeon becomes a vampire always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(bumpssores and the body vomits blood) Sunlight as is known in the vampire genre causes torturous death if exposed to Hyeon for a length of time Hyeon falls in lust with Tae-joo the wife of sickly childhood friend Kang-woo(Ha-kyun Shin) Tae-joo was taken in by Mrs Ra(Hae-sook Kim) regarded as a puppy and practically used as a domestic animal to be ordered around Ta-joo is miserable in this situation and begins a torrid affair she instigates with Hyeon soon manipulating him into perhaps killing Kang-woo by having him believe shes a victim of abuse Renouncing his priesthood Hyeon dives headlong into the relationship with Tae-joo soon a willing participant in killing Kang-woo This incident which Tae-woo contributed to(using a boat in the middle of a lake both proceeded to burying him underwater Tae-woo keeping him Kang-woo from re-surfacing as he attempted to re-enter)will haunt both as circumstances arise with Kang-woo missing(Hyeon got rid of him where police would not find his corpse) Soon Mrs Ra suffers a stroke(though one finger and the ability to blink her eyes contribute mightily as the story progresses showing that she more aware than they are led to believe) and Hyeon gives Tae-joo a special birthday giftvampirism In doing so Hyeon has created a monster Tae-joo admits(though a slip of the tongue)that in fact Kang-woo never hurt her and as she thirsts for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesnt bother her morally or psychologically Tae-joo becomes such a hand full Hyeon has to take desperate measures if he is to stop such a menace to society himself includedbr br I will say that Thirst is one of the best horror films Ive seen regarding 2009 Its a methodical approach Park takes and we are led down a dark road with Hyeon and Tae-joo as they commit terrible deeds with nothing positive ever to come from their unholy union Innocent people die because of Hyeons love(what once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the end)for Tae-joo and it will cease to end if he doesnt make a painful choice We see inside their heads their souls and it isnt always pretty 2 hours with them can be quite exhaustingbut credit to the director for pulling no punches in regards to devious behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people Hyeon seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening accepts hell for Tae-joo so one could look at Thirst as a unique love story but not exactly a healthy onebr br In regards to the violence while Park does have a tendency to pull away from extremely graphic details theres enough sadism involved to perhaps turn the stomach a bit At the very least the way the violence is carried out may be certain to leave a lasting impact The sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be pretty heated and erotic while also sordid and morally reprehensible The movie I think is still quite a complex examination of the lengths one will go to remain attached to an object of affection(lust)
The Priest into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?) http:plazarakutencojpconfuocodiary200911290000br br And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire She did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost but decided to leave human alone Fragile but lovely Femme fatale! This movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire that far beyond priest and salvation Also I thought about love Adam was not so responsible for Eves but this Adam(priest) sacrificial and responsible to pick Eve up from the Paradise Lost vampires world Another Symphonic Poem of Adam & Eve Paradise Lost
Theres this whole theory of horror that some people adhere closely to that the monsters and the violence should be kept off-screen Park Chan-Wook throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety from a stylistic perspective Park seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across Whether its long involved ensemble scenes with the camera whizzing around a mah-jong table or entire weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes dialog from the scenes before and after bleeding over them Park doesnt keep to a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the entire story of a couples relationship from virginal remove through utter codependence to utter self-annihilation--and uses vampirism as the link and priestliness as the drama Its that simple and that complex at the same timebr br You gotta give him credit Too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to Twilight with Twilight almost always being the lesser of the works but here the stories are actually comparable but this one is more raw and honest None of this sparkly coming in the window during the night to talk crap but anything ranging from the dirtiest most desperate and virginal sex scene to eventual spousal abuse as the two leads begin to vie for power over one another Its the same deal--guy and girl meet girl finds out guy is a vampire decides to join him anyway but with no happily ever after just straight-up limited time as they become forced to keep each other closer and closer and run out of options The girls motivations are particularly interesting as one desperately craving power and attention to a fault foiled by the guy who just wants to live a good life as best he can under the circumstances but is a hypocrite who cannot admit that hes merely using his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral trainingbr br The movie isnt perfect and it does tend to stretch (theres no three act five act or any act structure here just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance) but whats great about it is that Park Chan-Wook is willing to show everything frankly and honestly while delighting the horror sensibilities of tension and gore He also provides an expertly chosen soundtrack to hit the emotional high-notes in a pretty effective way toobr br --PolarisDiB

Of the Korean movies Ive seen only three had really stuck with me The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters The second and third - and now fourth too - have all been Park Chan Wooks movies namely Oldboy Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) and now Thirst br br Park kinda reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with his irreverence towards convention All his movies are shocking but not in a gratuitous sense Its more like he shows us what we dont expect to see - typically situations that go radically against societys morals like incest or a libidinous blood-sucking yet devout priest Hes also quite artistically-inclined with regards to cinematography and his movies are among the more gorgeous that Ive seenbr br Thirst is all that - being about said priest and the repressed conscience-less woman he falls for - and more Its horror drama and even comedy as Park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations As such this might be his best work for me yet since his other two movies that Ive seen were lacking the humor element that wouldve made them more palatable for repeat viewings
Oldboy director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie historybr br Trusting the latest Hollywood fad vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent asexual love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past well at least in the second halfbr br Thirst starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story The vampire transformation of a priest is over quite some time sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story which makes for some awkward viewing But the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory Well maybe not so surprisingly if you know Oldboy and Im a Cyborg but thats OK but I guess its fair to say that Thirst beats Parks earlier films in terms of in-your-face violence br br All in all be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some Thirst is original entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than Park Chun-wooks earlier endeavors
Chan-wook Park you have to hand it to the guy In my eyes hes not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfyingbr br Thirst is essentially a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the rules of the subgenre Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure dies and comes back All thanks to the blood he was transfused with Being the only one out of five hundred to survive he becomes quite the celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal Normal however now involves being able to leap great distances without injury wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when rays of sun get on his skin Its not long before hes living with a rather dysfunctional family unit who knew him in his childhood and while he hides his new strange lifestyle he finds himself drawn into a complex love triangle becoming more acceptable of darker thoughts and sliding down a slippery slope that could lead him from man to beast to monsterbr br Deftly blending a number of genres Parks movie felt much fresher and more original to me than Let The Right One In (to use a recent example) and genuinely impressed me with its approach to material that could easily have felt as well-worn and rehashed as any number of other vampire movies weve seen over the years Its a mixture of horror melodrama and comedy while also pondering ideas such as strength of faith the power over life and death the downside of immortality etc etcbr br Some people have complained that this genre-blending approach weakens the movie but I personally found that it was a lively entertaining and always enjoyable movie helped by a great central performance from Song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast with no weak links Many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability especially the young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the object of the priests love lust and affectionbr br Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular) and also fans of Poes The Tell-tale Heart (watch and learn) should lap this up its yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainmentbr br See this if you like: Cronos Near Dark Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man
The great thing about Thirst Chanwook Parks latest film is that its the anti-Twilight Some of you may take that as a minus but in reality its a big plus Park takes the method of vampirism seriously and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that unbeknownst to him turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire and Tae-Joo with her mother and idiot brother the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama Theres nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point and the implications put forth from religion early on (Sang for example is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism even as he just cant be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil push it up into another plane cinematicallybr br That Thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that Park has displayed with Oldboy Lady Vengeance and the underrated Im a Cyborg but Thats OK should be taken as a given Thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric part romanticerotic part dramatic and lastly fantastical And it doesnt always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set-up (though as a horror movie Park has more than his share of scary scenes) Its more akin to the movie Near Dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention and that the disease itself and its effect on a persons existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed Once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds youve seen em allbr br Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor much like Oldboy only here with a bite (pun intended) meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being An example of this can be found with the Priests predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor Or the manner in which Tae-Joo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive even as shes had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood-suckers whove brought pain and horror to her home But these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience What makes Thirst last in the mind is how elements come together of drama and existential pains of a Bunuelian-surreal sense of Catholicism (I especially loved the dynamic between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood-sucking but really wants to be a vampire too) and of the erotic: the scenes where the priest finally gives in to Tae-Joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets Not in a pornographic manner but in the sense of these characters release and escape which doesnt last long over the scope of the storybr br If its not as great as Oldboy its not something to carp about Not all films Chanwook Park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and at the least hell always be known as the man who directed that movie) But Thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general The film-making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous (and what a white room of daylight the characters live in!) the humor is dark and hilarious the acting is intense and moody- especially from subtle strokes from Song Kang-ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from Kim OK-vin and the ending when it does finally get there is one of those truly superb vampire-movie endings youll be talking about for years in a good way In a battle between Thirst and Twilight Thirst takes the knock-out in the first round Between Let the Right One In or Near Dark its tougher to call 9510
Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire Add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipebr br Directed in part in a style similar to the Sympathy trilogy its as sumptuous as it is dark Steering clear of cliché it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre Its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust However the film doesnt take itself too seriously and there is boundless humour throughoutbr br Our leads play their roles to perfection playing with our emotions and revelling in the dark humour There are moments of reflection on the whole moral conundrums involved in the film but its never preachy Some might find it overlong and it can lull at points but its worth giving it a chance to the endbr br If you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late Dark and engrossing it will pull in a crowd One Id recommend you give a try
After watching Oldboy I was a little disappointed by the rest of Parks work some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that Oldboy had This one does it is nothing like Oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is therebr br The acting is good with Kang-ho Song OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin delivering excellent performances Kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstepbr br The plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clichésbr br The directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen It does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever seebr br This is just a great film
Now that I have seen it it was NOT what I was expecting at least not until the very END I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did Having been first introduced to Parks work via Oldboy I was curious to how hed treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while Oldboy and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vamp movies For example the scene where Father Hyeon is realizing the beast growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and he is able to SEE the blood pumping through Tae-jus skin and his eyes widen in blood-lust for it That was a nice effect I was also happy that Park did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all I came away from Bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true Park fashion Additionally I liked that Park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we dont usually get this is Asia cinema During the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring Park treats you a little like Ghost of Christmas future coming to show you albeit a bit boringly what life is like outside your world Ah but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen Father and his burgeoning lust for Tae-ju and conflict with duty as a priest We almost start to root for them even until Park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong It wont spoil it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and I think youll come away from it with what Park wants you to come away with Dont expect Oldboy and stylization because thats not what youll get here A very interesting take on the genre indeed Those who missed the MANY literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie not Bakjwi After Bakjwi watch Let The Right One IN its also not what youll expect either
No pun intended Im not going to spoil anything about the story but its safe to assume that you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays And of course being a priest while being naughty exaggerates all that Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yetbr br If you have seen Wooks previous worksmovies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here While it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface it still has quite some heat hidden underneath And when that boils quite a few bad things start to happen But through all that dark there also moments of light (fun) to be had too A very stylistic and though provoking movie that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job 
The vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization There were many sub-genre films last year from a multitude of countries Ive reviewed many and have a few more to discuss Forgive my indulgence but since Ive recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple) Im going to now move outside of North America for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didnt see as of nowbr br Of the many effects of Twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies I hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides I think men are prone to hate Stephenie Meyers work (and its offspring) to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated Women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times We need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying (unequally) if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant Cue: Thirst This Korean film was directed by Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame There are two ways to dissect it Either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one Dont let me convince you that the film has no inclinations Its director is a man whose fame is story-driven action films Its protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on this later) Still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned There is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so one-sided that women could not enjoy it The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moonbr br The plot follows an Emile Zola novel called Thérèse Raquin which I have not read According to Wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man He kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her The two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead mans body between them They are thus driven to insanity but care for the womans ailing mother At the novels conclusion they try to kill each other discover each others plans and commit suicidebr br Now transcribe this nearly 150 year old French novel into modern South Korea and youve got Thirst Chan-Wook doesnt embellish the story enough to elevate this to must-see He often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration I think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative His use of the mother-in-law as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect See itbr br The protagonist is originally a devout Christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine He thus becomes the god he once was smitten with People flock to him and view him as a grand healer OK Thats really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship Yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic Christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it Instead of confronting the delusional people he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patientsbr br Lets continue with the Christian allusion The woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughter-in-laws treachery (finger waggles) The man kills her but resurrects her The two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans The man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him They both die but he atones for her crimes (and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominently)br br The woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior She is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive Vampirism magnifies their characteristics She becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge He becomes a demigod with a spirit His life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention
From the director of Oldboy comes this slick vampire flick Kang-ho Song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly mysterious virus His vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict but he is able to survive by robbing the hospitals blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some siphoned blood Because of his supposedly miraculous survival he comes into the lives of Ha-kyun Shins family Shin has cancer and his mother believes that Song can cure it Unfortunately Songs vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he cant help but fall for Shins young wife OK-vin Kim Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lovers The film from there goes in weird directions that I think one should experience for themselves What really should be mentioned is Chan-wook Parks mastery of the medium of cinema My God Ive rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers The major flaw of the film is that its a little incoherent especially near the beginning Park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals which can be difficult to follow at times But when it works man does it fly The film is also perversely hilarious The final sequence easily one of the best of the decade is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous OK-vin Kim should become a worldwide star after this film She gives one of the best performances of the year
I wont bore you with any synopsis chances are you already know them And hopefully you are already familiar with Park Chan-Wooks workbr br I STRONGLY disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that Park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah Because you know what? He HAS!!! The vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of Sympathy For Mr Vengeance with the frantic and extravagance of Oldboy? Park Chan-Wook has incredible style but his movies dont all share the SAME style! That has been true and remains true with the release of Thirst br br Thirst is an incredible picture it literally has EVERYTHING you want in a movie Jaw-dropping violence tasteful gore great humour incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes The story is so crazy that at no point can you guess what will happen next Im so happy to say that Park is back in top form with this fantastic dark-comic-vampire-love-story Watch it as soon as you can!
Thirstbr br I found that this film was beautifully crafted The cinematography was well above excellent I though almost any frame could be frozen and you would have yourself an exquisite photograph The use of color stands out most In many instances the camera was gliding through the scene and the work was flawlessbr br Park Chan Wooks direction was fantastic He had me believing unwaveringly in his far- fetched universe There were several touches of verbal and visual humor (of a dark nature) that just added another depth to the picture as a wholebr br The acting I would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enoughbr br For me the only place where this film lacked was in the story At times I will not lie the goings on between characters just did not make sense Sometimes the story flow was clunky Overall I was disappointed with the subdued narrative and I felt it ran a little too longbr br But I still recommend this film for its vision its visual flourish its dark humor and at the end of the day it is an interesting film even if imperfect 910
If you love Chan-wook Park you know what to expect His films are brutal poetic tragic and artistic with splashes of very grim humor THIRST is clearly Parks style and I loved every second of it from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story which blends Shakespearean tragedy murderous love Gothic horror and layered character drama The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR VENGEANCE there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing Chan-wook Park is an intelligent bold consistently surprising filmmaker Its unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart-wrenching to laugh-out-loud hilarious in an instant This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE then SYMPATHY FOR MR VENGEANCE as far as being over-the-top and comical But like LADY VENGEANCE its incredibly rich thought-provoking and rewardingbr br If you like beautifully told vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park seeing THIRST should be obvious Easily one of the best films of 2009
Not for the squeamish but the number of twists inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology gorgeous visual extremes together with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most stunning horror films Ive ever seen It descends into utter madness along with characters but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose There are copious amounts of bloodletting accompanied by some nasty sucking and squishing sounds but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud As he tends to do Chan-wook Park keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters br br And theres a lot of literal leaping Keeping in the vein of vampire myth (pun intended) they have superhuman strength and can nearly leap tall buildings in a single bound (to coin a phrase) The first time our heroine is carried by the across the tops of buildings by the troubled vampire priest it has all the magical romance of Lois Lane and Superman - but this romance becomes increasingly disturbing - but driven by a strange and conflicted love affair not by mere horrorbr br The acting is superb particularly OK-vin Kim the gorgeous actress in the female lead role who at 22 shows a range that is remarkable The character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type She careens from innocent to impish to vixen to demon with utter conviction This is a really smooth and nervy performance br br If you love real art in horror or are a fan of Oldboy - dont wait for the video see it immediately
I know little or nothing about astronomy but nevertheless; I was at first a little sceptical about the plot of this movie It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers The plot does sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and as you know Saturn is the emotion planet it all falls into place; makes complete sense and its then that you know you arent simply watching another silly 80s slasher with a pea brain plot Thank god for that! Seriously though Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise but it more than makes up for that with its originality Having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema but when given the choice between this and another dull Friday the 13th clone - I know what Id choosebr br Also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think its silly plot dug it into is the fact that its extremely entertaining Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore This film however keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids (which harks back to creepy kid classics such as Village of the Damned) a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension One thing that I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry Theres nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (cough Halloween cough) but thats not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows There wasnt any room for a chainsaw which is a huge shame but I suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it
Three children are born at the exact same timeduring a lunar eclipseJust before their 10th birthday they embark on a killing spreeBloody Birthday is a typical slasher from early 80sIts a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudityThe evil children never generate any menace and there is almost no suspenseThere is also no gore or scares in Bloody Birthdaybut the film is mildly entertainingUnfortunately no real explanation is provided for the kids sudden homicidal maniaThe murder scenes are quite gruesome for example weve got death by handgunbaseball batskipping rope and shovelSo if youre a fan of early 80s slasher movies give this one a look
I thought I was going to watch another Friday The 13th or a Halloween rip off But I was surprised Its about 3 psycho kids who kill Theres not too many movies like that I can think of Mikey Children Of The Corn and a few others Its not the greatest horror movie but its a least worth a rent
Three kids are born during a solar eclipse and turn into vile murderous little tykes whore above suspicion by everyone save for Joyce (Lori Lethin) and her younger brother Timmy Thats the story in a nutshell The acting in this one is tolerable for the most part Notable for MTV-J Julie Brown (not the Downtown one) showing some skin and a very early part (albiet small) for Michael Dudikoff Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but in the killer kids sub-genre its a bit of a guilty pleasurebr br Eye Candy: Julie Brown shows T&A (the only film thus far to claim that honor); Sylvia Wright gets topless br br DVD Extras (R1): 16 minute interview with Producer Max Rosenberg (wherein he insults the director AND Canada great stuff); Biography of Ed Hunt; and trailers for Kiss of the Taratula Dont open the Door & a red-band one for Homework (which features nudity) br br My Grade: B-
Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers Nice-girl local teen Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanorsbr br Hearkening back to films like The Bad Seed and Village of the Damned this films premise of evil children may not be wholly original but its still pretty disturbing All three of the child actors - Elizabeth Hoy Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman - are chillingly convincing Director Ed Hunt and his co-writer Barry Pearson maintain the unpleasant yet compelling mood for the duration of the film; they go so far as to have the little girl charge admission for an unwilling peep show involving her older sister (future stand-up comedienne and MTV personality Julie Brown whose striptease is a real eyeful)br br Name actors Susan Strasberg as an icy teacher and Jose Ferrer with barely any screen time as a doctor add to the proceedings with their presence while KC Martel one of the youngsters from the original The Amityville Horror is very likable as Joyces kid brother Other familiar faces like Ellen Geer B-movie he-man Michael Dudikoff Cyril OReilly (Porkys Dance of the Damned) Joe Penny (Jake and the Fatman) and William Boyett (The Hidden) can be seen as wellbr br Touching upon such parental fears as children playing with guns that theyve discovered and being locked inside old refrigerators Bloody Birthday is a little more than just a slasher variation with kids as antagonists Aided and abetted by Arlon Obers music score this film sticks in the memory more than some of its brethren without lots of gore to fall back on (although that arrow through the eye gag works quite well)br br Bleak nasty and downbeat Bloody Birthday is worth a look for the curiousbr br 710
Story about three eclipse (maybe even Indigo ha) children beginning their love for murder Oh and the people who are hot on their trailbr br Bloody Birthday a pretty mediocre title for the film was a nice lil surprise I was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood-thirsty psychopath kids And I may say its also one of the best flicks Ive seen with kids as the villains By the end of the movie I seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashionbr br Its a really solid 80s horror flick but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you cant not think about Even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil sh!ts as the murderers But there seems to be only a couple police in town well by the end only one and he seemed like a dimwit so I suppose they could have gotten away with it Haha yeah and Im a Chinese jet-pilotbr br Nevertheless this movie delivered some evilass kids who were more than entertaining a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage No kiddin! If youre put off by the less than stellar title dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot Its a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters Steven (Andy Freeman) Curtis (Billy Jayne;credited as Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) were all born on the same day during an eclipse Besides sharing a birthday they also share a love of murder (and theyre not picky about who they kill either) Young Billy Elizabeth and Andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too But they cant go on fooling everyone This is an overall good horror flick its not too unrealistic there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well (the grown-ups are pretty hammy though) Id say its well worth seeing (I own a copy myself)
This agreeably perverse and oddball early 80s teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent pinnacle of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous moppets movie Devil Times Five but its still an above average killer kid opus nonethelessbr br The slim but serviceable plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes -- two bratty boys and one creepily twinkle-eyed albeit angelic-looking little girl -- who are all born during a solar eclipse on June 9th 1970 When the strange antisocial trio who stick together in a tightly self-contained and exclusive circle reach ten years of age they suddenly go homicidally bonkers and declare open season on the hapless unsuspecting local yokels of the heretofore sleepy and peaceful California suburb of Meadowvale Writerdirector Ed Hunt the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey Starship Invasions the uproariously inane Jesus Christ vigilante parable (!) Alien Warrior and the stunningly silly The Brain does a pretty solid and capable job here: the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal (the arrow-through-the-eye gag is especially nasty) theres a sizable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft-core sex a goodly amount of tension is neatly created and maintained some nice dollops of dark humor punctuate the arrestingly warped mayhem and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly joltingbr br Moreover the top-drawer cast further elevates the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing: Jose Ferror as a small-town doctor future Jake and the Fatman TV series star Joe Penny as an amateur astrologer The Prey s Lori Lethin as the plucky babysitter heroine Susan Strasberg as a bitchy school teacher American Ninja s Michael Dudikoff as a chowderhead jock and Cyril OReilly (the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy Dance of the Damned) as a libidinous teen dude who gets bagged while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a parked van Billy Jacoby (who went on to star in such late 80s direct-to-video dross as Dr Alien and Demonwarp) Andy Freeman and especially the eerily adorable Elizabeth Hoy are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible troika of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats And yes thats none other than Julie Brown the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise Top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune The Homecoming Queens Gotta Gun as the lovely vacuous full-breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy totally extraneous yet still sizzling and much-appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song! All in all this baby sizes up as a sturdy and satisfying slasher item
This movie is great 80s sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse so they kill everyone they see The reason they kill makes practically no sense but it just adds to the charm of this movie And dang these kids are crazy especially Curtis If youve seen the movie you know who I am talking about That kids vicous! Although the movie doesnt have much gore it is entertaining and for some reason you kind of care about the characters It also has some nice nudity Has some decent acting as well really a decent 80s slasher movie its worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it Youll have nightmares about those darn kids though I guarantee you!
Sorry about the extremely clever summary phrase I dont know what I was thinking but I really couldnt help myselfbr br Ive been meaning to see Bloody Birthday for a long time and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price And believe me I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely to happen Its a real shame that some of these gems from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten Bloody Birthday is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays Not a masterpiece for sure but still entertaining and guess what? it doesnt really have unintentionally funny scenes I know its a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people But trust me the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most partbr br In Blood Birthday the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse According to astrology during eclipses the sun and the moon block Saturn which controls emotions As a consequence the three children who are born that day eventually become uncaring and evil Since they dont experience any feelings of remorse whatsoever these 10-year-old kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way including their own parents and siblings and kill them! The body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that theres a psychopath lurking around the place In the meantime Debbie Curtis and Steven dont hesitate to keep butchering people since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces (?)br br Like I was saying before Bloody Birthday is surprisingly NOT funny I know I said that before but Im truly surprised by this I was expecting some hilariously bad scenes but the movie proved me wrong True its not exactly what most people would consider a serious horror movie but if I have to be fair Id say that the story is decently executed One of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations (like I did) its because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable Lets face it: kids tend to be horrible actors which is understandable and we cant blame them for that But to my surprise the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny The rest of the actors are also good and if youre a George Clooney fan you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie Yeah I know right? who cares? Also Julie Brown the great actress singer comedienne and gay icon gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked Too bad she didnt have more time on the screen though! Julie is absolutely fabulous:Pbr br So basically this movie is fine if youre in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s My only objection regarding Bloody Birthday would be the way to justify the childrens motives This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film Lets see: if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people? Im sure there were other children who had been born the same day and during other days of total eclipse too oh well! Overall no big deal its just a simple observation thats all Ive seen worse trust me Take The Children (1980) for example in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud No believe me Bloody Birthday is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers youre going to enjoy this one very muchbr br So now you know: youre invited to the childrens birthday party and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests Come on you cant miss it ;)
Three ten-year-old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends thembr br While killer kid movies werent exactly new at the time of this twisted 80s slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film Bloody Birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities It straddles a fine line between cheesy and creepy but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot Theres some strong murder scenes as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasurebr br The cast does a fairly good job Young stars Elizabeth Hoy and KC Martel deliver some menacing performances while rising star Julie Brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well as the teacher and Jose Ferrer has a cameo appearancebr br All around this off-beat slasher entry isnt bad though its admittedly not flawless but it is well worth watching for genre fansbr br  out of 
This movie is not the scariest of all time but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget no stars lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well A nice starting point for Just Say Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career This film wont be seen by many but for fans of 80s horror its a must
An absolute classic of 80s scare flix This one isnt like any other as it pits pint-size wild-eyed psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown-ups in town Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (80s gold again) plays one of the killer-kids and hes paired up with one of the little girls Jake Blues tries to purchase in the BLUES BROTHERS There is a third blond boy but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots The demonic gang of smiling kids though somehow possessed by extra-planetary means bear little resemblance to the droid-ish Children of the Damned who never thought to use pistols crossbows and shovels to kill those pesky adults Julie Brown (not Downtown Julie Brown-the other one) shows her rack like three times as she dances around in her bedroom This movie is a rarity that I cannot believe I missed growing up in the 80s This would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if I had seen it Where is the sequel the ending begs for? This movie is just incredible Seek it out at all costs
I cant believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely wont be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that Bloody Birthday is awful viewing On the contrary I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers Dont just refer to this film as being another 80s slasher because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers Were introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse At the moment they were delivered planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience This really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spreebr br Granted this stuff is incredibility far-fetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who cares? Unlike many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative For once the kids acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music The murders sequences are grim and tense and its always eerie to see them getting committed by angel-faced kids I dont know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job Especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable The bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as Village of the Damned The Bad Seed and Children of the Damned This film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this br br Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt Not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like The Brain and Starship Invasions If all this isnt enough to convince you yet Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity And not just any nudity but a topless dance-act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown Oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by Joe Penny later the star of TV-series Jake and the Fatman Check it out!!
Interesting cartoon included on the DVD of The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra I especially like the way the color was used in the background art--very artistic for Columbia whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it!)br br I do wonder however how a certain um finger gesture ever got past the censors Granted the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today Youd think someone besides the animators would have noticed though--especially since its seen three times in the scene in question! And based on the context I suspect that its inclusion was intentional something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors WOULD notice!
Having just seen Walt Disneys The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks The colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another ones off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short It does get a little repetitious near the end Still Skeleton Frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier Silly Symphony
In 1929 director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their Silly Symphonies series The Skeleton Dance Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in Disneys Laugh-O-Gram cartoon series; however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio That was the birth of Celebrity Productions where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog) While his work kept the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed Later that year Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in colorbr br 1937s Skeleton Frolics is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic The Skeleton Dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune Like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play The dead rise from their coffins ready for the show thats about to begin as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune Now its not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra: its hard to dance with loose body parts Everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their gravesbr br Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself Skeleton Frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by The Skeleton Dance years before although with a crucial difference: Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor The bright tonalities allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before It is certainly a more experimental film than The Skeleton Dance although sadly this doesnt mean its necessarily a better film For starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney with the only differences being the music (more on that later) and the color effects It looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after allbr br However it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film (after all Iwerks executes it in a wonderful way) but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl W Stalling for The Skeleton Dance In other words while DeNats tune is effective and appropriate for the theme its easy to forget about it rapidly while Stallings song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable Being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down Iwerks flawless work of animation Personally I think that with a better musical accompaniment Skeleton Frolics would be remembered as fondly as The Skeleton Dance despite not being as groundbreaking as its still a fun film to watchbr br Its kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disneys main rival) he did not lack the quality of those companies films It was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to Disneys mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney Despite its shortcomings Skeleton Frolics is a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film (one just cant help but thinking of The Skeleton Dance while watching it) it definitely reminds us that Iwerks skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire usbr br 810
First time I saw this great movie and Alyssa my star playing Frances Ella Fitz was so great in this movie! It was just so real and her little dog so cute!

While Boris(Aleksey Batalov)is off to fight in war against the Germans for his Mother Russia his beloved Veronika(Tatyana Samojlova)marries his conniving cousin Mark(Aleksandr Shvorin)in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over Moscow Through various trials and betrayals Veronika will await word or letter from Boris no matter how long it takes holding hope that he will return to herbr br Powerful piece of film-making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky Some of the many magnificently framed moving shots include the scene where the camera follows Veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to Borisand doesnt quite reach him even as we watch Boris looking impatiently into the swarm without luck The sequence after the air raid where Veronika walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where Mark makes his lustful move on Veronika as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light emanate inside are just two of MANY examples where Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film But without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly deeply love each other this film couldnt hold up with the beauty of the visual alone Together however were left with an amazing filmsimply a haunting masterpiece from the Soviet Union after Stalin breathed his last breath I feel honored just have beheld such a great film
In my review just submitted I referred to the young actress lead as Katerina when it should have been Veronika I was so involved with character and the action I guess that I wasnt that concerned with names Anyway she and the film are brilliant As I said the cinematography and the directors use of montage are worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman Tisse The production design is top notch The placement of actors in the foreground middle ground and background within any given mise en scene is worthy of study Stunning memorable camera movement and an ending that has an emotional punch that leaves Hollywood films far behind Gee! Heroic self sacrifice instead of walking into the rainbow Thanks again John Hart
This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema By seeing this filmwe can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgysuch a strong and adequate use of sound-image montageand almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life Cinema was then not only one form of arts It was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war It is said that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years! Audience that time was also different I read that after seeing Kurosawas Ikiru(Live) in its first release young couple quietly told each otherIt is a good film isnt it? I thinkcontemporary cinema though technically developed and opened some new narrative perspective has lost the most important---reliance of audienceCienma was once really the most popular art from and unlike modern fine arts and contemporary musicgave millions of people hope and ideals In this point of viewLetyat zhuravli must be in the pantheon of classics of all the time as City lightIkiru and La Strada
I watched this movie on TCM last night all excited expectation having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto I told my wife who hadnt seen it before to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot no cuts where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus and darts among the tanks to cross the road THEN I remember that no cuts we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through anxiously looking for him but does not find him But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women all extras and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior How one wonders did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street dodging the tanks the scene abruptly ended and cut back to scenes at the apartment before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence Seems to me that this film was not only restored but also re-edited What a downer!
If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war you need to see Letyat zhuravli (called The Cranes are Flying in English) It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) who are in love on the verge of WWII They are walking along the waterfront watching the cranes fly by when the war starts Boris is promptly sent off to war Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son whom she does not love Boris meanwhile continues trotting through the countryside fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war until he he runs out of energy When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news she refuses to accept it until Boris body arrives home on one of the trains Simultaneously the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allied Powers have won the war; the Soviet Union lost 27 million citizens but its the start of a new erabr br This movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield but also how it affected the civilian population This is definitely a movie that everyone should see
This is a magnificent and in many ways impressive film I saw it on TV as a little boy with my throat almost strangled with tears and again today on the magnificently restored Criterion DVDbr br Cranes is the very essence of the War Weepie Imagine Umbrellas of Cherbourg with no music and no color or Waterloo Bridge with no class consciousnessbr br Tatiana Samoilova a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé enlists and doesnt write or come backbr br The fiancé Boris dies on the front and his death scene is indescribably romantic Very daring too because so close to over the top But that scene will stay with youbr br Although the Soviets were so defined by WWII the movie is quite unspecific and more powerful for it The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel There is no attempt at period detail The whole film becomes more and more stylized until the Siberian scenes which feel like a modern opera set (that is a compliment) The cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop - there again comparable to Cherbourg The production feels like a big budget (those staircase scenes must have cost a pretty kopek)br br Go for it Dont expect a bitter socialist pill (although it is of course very sad) The Cranes are Flying is an impressive slice of world cinema quite advanced considering where and when it was made
Im out of words to describe the beauty of The Cranes are Flying but Ill try anyway to write about it Its a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the Second World War Its the classic story of lovers (Boris & Veronika) separated by the war and of what comes between them The films images are so gorgeous that youll be carried away - the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotionbr br There are few scenes that portray directly the war: A bombing - wind lightnings explosions - that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist Veronika who waits for the return of Boris; and theres another scene on the front where we we will be confronted by a emotionalvisual hurricane showing the images played in Boris mind Another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title - the cranes flying in the sky This image stands as a the symbol for Nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film: Not to give up hope and fight for a better futurebr br Kalatozov is a great director this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply It is not just pure technique br br Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika What more can I say? The film transcends the time it was made - the action takes place during the Second World War But it could have happened anytime anywhere As long there are wars (great or small) the film and its message will remain relevant
Sick of the current cinema output particularly American cinema Ive been making an effort to see the Oscar-winning foreign films Thats when I came across this gem Slow to start it picks up nicely once war is declared Basically an old fashioned girl-waits-for-boy-to-return-from-war-story the performances the cinematography make this so very much more Why Tatyana Samojlova as the young woman didnt become an international star after this is beyond me(though she has remained successful in her own country) You take the journey with her: young defiant impetuous young girl who through the ravages of war becomes a very sober somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope (her final scene is devastating) We love her as much as the camera does And the camera-work! Was this the pioneer in hand-held camera work? It truly adds an immediacy to the story And the beauty of it (like when Tatyanas character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence) I am humbled and grateful to see this film
This is a fantastic film The acting is some of the best Ive seen Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting The The cinematography was extremely ahead of its time Watching it I could see parallels of cinematography used today This is truly a groundbreaking film Because of the cinematography and acting the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes Its a very touching and powerful piece My friend told me it was must see and I definitely agree with her This is one of those films that you watch and never forget Everyone should see this intensely moving film This should be put on everyones Movies to See Before ________ (whatever) list
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work The opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographers album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look All is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking Difficult to describe without spoiling but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lovers brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter Another superimposes a swirling staircase and a spinning shot of tree tops and even develops into a fantasy sequence Soviet film making of the highest order
Director Mikhail Kalatozovs film The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov based on his own play Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable However this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us straight from a soldiers mouth how war is hated by all that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting we see a new vision of WWII We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they dont believe in With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East and how people are dying for no reason against their will its nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are as well as those awaiting their returnbr br Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war While Boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not I dont know There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country it is all praise and thanks Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everydaybr br The acting is top-notch throughout but some deserve singling out I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris grandmother She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language Vasili Merkuryev as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich brings what is perhaps the best performance As spoken at the end about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments He puts on a tough exterior especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave But when Boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man seated in sorrow at the table He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him his actions throughout the film express it to the audience Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris a happy-go-lucky young man and idealist doing what he believes is right and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark staying home due to his talented piano skills or maybe just to steal his cousins love That love played by Tatyana Samojlova really draws the audience in to her grief dejection and slim glimmer of hope The true star of the film she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way needing to steer back on course hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris returnbr br Besides the realism to the story as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across I also loved the visual style of the film Sergei Urusevskys cinematography is amazing especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water a bridge in the background at the top as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times Sharp angles are utilized as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame togetherbr br The real feats however are those instances of the long shot Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris her own farewell needing to be said The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people the camera focuses on couples kisses people yelling to one another and more all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through Everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema Its just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en scène can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible Composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do
Mikhail Kalatozovs The Cranes are flying is a superb film Winner of the golden palm at Cannes Film Festival it has an excellent cinematography and performance by Tatyana Samojlova the only Russian actor ever to win an award in Cannes for a performance She plays Veronika a teenager in love with her boyfriend happy and without preoccupations with plans of getting married Her life will get upside down when World War II strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army The film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight waiting for a letter or other information It is a portrayal of lost innocence Samojlova does a magnificent job and her character transformation will break your heart The camera movement is fast with a lot of close-ups it is a dancing camera The first scene in the stairs is fantastic but it isnt the only one there is later a scene when Veronika attempts committing suicide and another in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history the bombing of Veronikas house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire to find her apartment completely destroyed Simply great! 10 out of 10
Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilmentbr br In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreamsbr br But Man is not a bird Life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort War breaks out and without much hesitation Boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty He cannot even say good-bye to Veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away Surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract Boris attention must inevitably failbr br Boris eventually gets killed in war without Veronica learning about it for the moment His brother Mark a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption is eager to take his place Veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms A marriage takes place which is never accepted by the familybr br Soon feelings of guilt seize hold of Veronica and she realizes that Boris return is the one and only thing she actually longs for She therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the self-sacrificing work in a field hospitalbr br When war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers Again Veronica is among them forcing her way through a wall of bodies In her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris deathbr br Once again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines But now Veronica is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one She has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams For all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fatebr br 
Its not difficult after watching this film to see why post-silent Soviet cinema is held in such little critical esteem Dont get me wrong THE CRANES ARE FLYING is for the first half at least supremely entertaining boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin; a fresh brisk spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms; two stunning subjective set-pieces; and a romantic verve that flirts with but never quite topples into Lelouch territory Its just that  in its subsuming of vast social national and world events to a love affair it is essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood moviebr br Of course in a Soviet Union that emphasised the state above all else and in an era (World War Two) that suppressed individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism this foregrounding of two appealing young lovers is a relief And the thematic similarities - all consuming love rent apart by war - with two of the most wonderful of all films (SEVENTH HEAVEN LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also adds to its potential loveabilitybr br The story is simple enough Boris a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family and Veronika a student conduct a breezy relationship at night their only free time Boriss cousin Mark a composer also has eyes on Veronika When the Nazis invade Russia Boris secretly volunteers to the chagrin of his family and lover He promises to write to Veronika but never does thinking maybe she hasnt bothered to see him off or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable Veronikas parents die during an air raid and she moves in with Boriss family helping out at the hospital where his father tends wounded soldiersbr br Distressed by Boriss silence Veronika is also assailed by the attentions of Mark who has gained exemption from military duty by bribing a local official She is eventually worn down and marries him to the disapproval of her adopted family Boris meanwhile is killed in action Veronika disgusted with herself and an adulterous Mark refuses to believe this and awaits his return fostering a young orphan bearing his namebr br The title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love symbolic perhaps of its transcendant epiphanical power But this is illusory - the cranes fly in a V formation and this shape pervades the entire film through the geometric shapes of buildings interiors exteriors groupings of people composition camera angles the heroines name - or by editing in which feet walking southwest in one story are met by feet walking southeast in another br br This serves to fatally trap the lovers who have no control over their destinies and also suggest the Stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film Although the pair seem to be free in space whether literally in an unpeopled environment or privileged in generous close-ups they are always ironised minimised torn apart - by circumstances families by crowds (see the brilliant if obvious sequences where Veronika is engulfed by tanks or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd) or simply by the films structure which is constantly distancing through paralellism their closeness Although at the beginning the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll it is constantly being broken by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of musicbr br What is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasising historical forces The whole film but especially the war itself is strangely unreal and dreamlike we are never shown its harsh brutal actuality just its effects on the lovers In fact it is transformed into a majestic spectacle devoid of nasty Germans br br On the home front the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade or ruins of almost Gothic decadence In the bunker the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than Boriss perceived indifference The empty oneiric Moscow spaces the lovers initially than Veronika with her mother walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces br br When Mark tries to force himself on Veronika the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations This is a brilliant sequence filmed with silent Expressionistic terror in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence all the more compelling for the earlier scenes wistful gentlenessbr br Its not much different at the front either where fights over girls honour are more urgent than tactics Nazis or despair The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is a further abstracting of the experience of war its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic; and Boris final pre-death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream-wish fulfillment and heightened anxiety in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesquebr br From this point on the film becomes a little less interesting slightly more obvious One more grasp for Expressionist overload - Veronikas attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant - is clumsily handled; and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film The use of deep focus at first ravishing soon becomes wearing devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning Welles brought to its use in CITIZEN KANE After what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end when individual suffering as so often in Russian art transmutes into symbolic (ie sexless dehumanised) hope A pity
Unlike the many who have posted here Im not movie literate I stumbled across this movie by accident (channel surfing) and couldnt surf away This is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it The actors are terrific Tatiana is beautiful and innocent Her fiancé Boris is sweet and patriotic You couldnt help but feel Boris fathers exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great warbr br Others have summarized the movie so well so Ill just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most When Boris brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry Tatiana Tatianas twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal (even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape) You fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on Tatiana and the brother or worse show Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence Since this isnt French existential cinema the latter doesnt happen Thankfully! br br Another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris father of the death of his son He unwittingly breaks the news to Tatiana I cant describe the sorrow of this scene StillTatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that Boris will yet come home The musician actually never saw Boris buried after allbr br I wont mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches of Soviet political correctness didnt detract at all from the film Boris brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brothers wife-to-be would have to be No doubt he gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film! The ending when Tatiana finally learns for certain that Boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future You dont even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war with their own losses in mind first saw this moviebr br Incredible Go see it
The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema In the early years of the 1950s film production came close to a complete standstill {a mere nine feature-films were released in 1951} and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored and often censored by the government Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years It wasnt until 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is widely-considered the first post-Stalin Soviet masterpiece Letyat zhuravli  The Cranes are Flying one of the finest depictions of war Ive seen from any country or time period Not only was the film lauded for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union but international recognition was soon to follow and Kalatozovs film was honoured with the Palm dOr at the 1958 Cannes Film Festivalbr br The Cranes are Flying is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious humanistic portrayal of war Unlike many Soviet war-themed films of the time it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional war-time hero and more concerned with the futility brutality and indeed the inevitability of conflict Love as a cinematic concept is too-often idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship and yet the reality is substantially less romantic In the film two lovers Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) separated by the advent of the WWII {widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945} pledge to marry after the war but tragedy denies the couple their wish Driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting Veronika agrees to wed Boris cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) a handsome but unworthy youth The film may conclude with the proud victory of the Soviets and a patriotic flag-waving parade but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist who wanders soullessly through the celebrating crowdsbr br Perhaps the most remarkable feature of The Cranes are Flying is Sergei Urusevskys inspired and dynamic hand-held cinematography which realistically and dizzily captures the chaos and confusion of war not necessarily in the hail of gunfire and the cries of dying comrades {in fact only one of the films sequences joins Boris on the Eastern Front} but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind In one particularly impressive oft-cited long shot the camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families The hand-held camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus jostles through the crowd alongside her - capturing momentary snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands - before unexpectedly craning above the crowd as Veronika disappears into the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode Urusevsky first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of hand-held photography: The camera he once declared can express what the actor is unable to portray: his inner sensations The cameraman must act with the actors
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and its not difficult to see why (A few spoilers - but for the ending youll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family Mark Boris cousin rapes Veronika who feels obligated to marry him Degraded and demeaned by the cowardly Mark Veronika clings to the hope that someday Boris will return Superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director Kalatozov (For anyone interested in film technique another movie by Kalatozov I AM CUBA has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana rises two stories to a cigar factory tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long long avenue - all without a cut) Superb acting particularly by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris uncle) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement A devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by Samoilova (This movie is frequently linked with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier)
Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of the young Audrey Hepburn and the camera in THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her just as much She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of World War II in Moscowbr br The film is almost poetic in its gorgeous B&W cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place since I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on TCMbr br Its a very moving love story about a girls deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime Russia Shes unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from Their marriage is a troubled one because she cant let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheartbr br By the end of the story she accepts the idea that hes never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation Theres a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous familiesbr br The stylish and striking camera-work is what carries the film as well as the honestly played storybr br Tastefully done but perhaps the English subtitles didnt tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed overbr br Summing up: Easy to see why it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival Reminded me in style of another great Russian film BALLAD OF A SOLDIER
While watching this film recently I constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957and in the USSR! That makes it all the more remarkable Many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002 but they were quite original in 1957 I first saw this film in 1963 when it was first released in the US and I was struck by its originality then Now just having seen it 40 years later I have no reason to change my mind
I had long wanted to watch this romantic drama (with a WWII setting) and now that I have all I can say is that its a veritable masterpiece of Russian cinema! br br Soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but thankfully this ones free of such emphasis - with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which hell never return The girl (a remarkable performance from Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young mans cousin and when she doesnt receive word from her boyfriend gives in to the latter and marries him He however is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and knowing too that the girls still devoted to the soldier begins to neglect her Finally word reaches the girl of her loved ones death but by the end of the film she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of himbr br The film features some truly amazing camera-work which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and by frequently adopting tracking tilted and high or low angle shots renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama Individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: the stunning scene frenetically edited and sped-up to boot in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck; and the young mans premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front undoubtedly one of the best of its kind Ive ever watched (with the sun moving away from him symbolizing the life thats seeping out of his body as he imagines the wedding day hell never have!) Also notable however is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home thats been hopelessly devastated during an air raid; as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist - which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face - taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains!br br Disappointingly the R1 DVD of this outstanding film is a bare-bones affair (the RusCiCo edition features a few supplements but being an export tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot!); Criterion released it in conjunction with another war-themed Russian classic BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959) - which my pal at the local DVD rental outlet has told me is forthcoming br br The only other film Ive watched from this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969; albeit via the much-shorter US-release version!) a star-studded international production based on true events; given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING I regret missing out now on his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) a number of times when I was in Hollywood late last year: apart from receiving a one-week theatrical run it was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a feature-length Making Of!!
A true masterpiece of the Soviet cinematography Its a shame for the Soviet Union that Samojlova was never given an opportunity to play in the Western movies -- but then again she would probably never find herself there In Letyat Zhuravli she is unforgettable This was one of the few movies where I was cryingbr br In addition to Samojlova Batalov and Merkurjev who are top rate it was a brilliant work of the director and the operator which made this movie an all-time classics world-wide Just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy German bombardment or the death of Boris with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies The very simple means -- but the great technique added to the emotional weight Mind you 20 years before The Star Wars 41 years before Titanic and with a Soviet budget
In Moscow the young couple Veronika (T Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are in deep love for each other With the World War II Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before Veronikas birthday and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other While waiting for news from Boris Veronika is raped by Boris cousin Mark (A Shvorin) and they marry each other However Veronika does not forget Boris and keeps waiting for himbr br Letyat zhuravli is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in times of war The direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story inclusive in the capital scene when Veronika is raped by Mark The camera-work is amazing with sophisticated planes and angles and long traveling The scenes of Veronika in the middle of the tanks or in the train station with many figurants are awesome The magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the DVD T Samojlova has an extremely beautiful face and a touching and sensitive performance The speech in the last scene makes another great example of an anti-war movie My vote is ninebr br Title (Brazil): Quando Voam as Cegonhas (When Fly the Stork)
It does not surprise me that this short (91 minutes) BW movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ottepel or the thaw has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world It is sublime and beautifully filmed Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time Sergei Urusevskys camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman It is also the film about loyalty memories ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for; it is about forgiveness and about hope The film received (absolutely deservingly) the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at Cannes for playing Veronika the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie After separation with her beloved who went to the front the loss of her family in the bomb ride and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed she turned to the shadow of herself she became dead inside Her long journey to redemption to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply wont leave any viewer indifferentbr br For me the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning I walked the same streets squares and bridges over the Moskva River Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger cold and illnesses during WWII and my family is not exception My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books Cranes are Flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply It is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life - my background my memory and my past
One of those films that I happened across through The Criterion Collection and as usual indulged as a change of pace That turned out to be a great decision I was almost mesmerised by the quality of the film the story it told and the way it was told The almost minimalist feel to the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a whole evocative level to the film This really is a superb film to spend some time with and enjoy
I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie If at one point or another you thought youve seen good camera work be prepared to be amazed by this movie For the record this movie was made in 1957 in Russia but the technique used here is probably something that weve seen much later in the western worldabout 20 years later The level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot: happiness -love-war- despair-joy but in the end you remain with something quite unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking The young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similareven though I think movies like this are very hard to come by If youve seen I am Cuba  then this movie would appeal to you very much but if not be prepared for a unique experience The Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets great actors and a joy of creating artand yes they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together I am not a big fan of Russia actually I hate everything thats communist but the film making in that part of the world manages to create such feelings that are hard to describebr br Enjoy itbr br 
The plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind: the violent clash between Adolf Hitlers Germany and Soviet Russia from 1941-45br br With the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated and 20 to 30 million Russian people killed the vibes of this conflict can be felt in Russia up to the present day Let alone back in 1957 when memories were still very fresh and painfulbr br This very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of Letjat zhuravlis beautiful shots Its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war: bravery love patriotism weakness cowardice and corruption All beautifully tied together by a toy-squirrelbr br Add to this the truly magnificent acting and its easy to understand why this movie is so famous Really one of the very best ever made br br 
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love was just as strong as in the West and war was often more poignant (should I say more realistic ?)br br This film is as much about war and love as it is about the Soviet thaw of Mr Ks era It also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990s with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of USD spent on special effects and marketed actorsbr br This movie is a classic of Soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies : warbr br 
If youre looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the testosterone-pumped carnage-craving war buffs out there dont bother Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII dont expect to see any Nazis cannons blood gore etc Its not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war Its a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with itbr br Acting cinematography writing: all perfect 10s here Youll certainly appreciate it if youre Russian like me but even if not youll probably love it If you speak no Russian look for the RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) DVD version Its got subtitles in about 14 different languages but the English dubbing on this one Id say is just as good Its of course not as good as the original Russian track (some stuff is lost in translation) but just as good as the English subtitles So go check it out especially if youre studying film in any aspect
1956 was the 20th Congress of the Communist Party and the Soviet Premier Krushchev made a speech denouncing Stalin and the Stalinist purges and the gulag labor systems revealing information that was previously forbidden publicly revealing horrible new truths which opened the door for a new Soviet Cinema led by Mikhail Kalatozov once Stalins head of film production This film features a Red Army that is NOT victorious in fact they are encircled in a retreat mode with many people dying including the hero in a film set after 06-02-41 the German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced the Barbarossa Plan a blitzkrieg invasion intended to bring about a quick victory and the ultimate enslavement of the Slavs and very nearly succeeded actually getting within 20 miles of Moscow in what was a Red Army wipe out a devastation of human losses 15 to 20 million Russians died or 20% of the entire population Historically this was a moment of great trauma and suffering a psychological shock to the Russian people but the Red Army held and prolonged the war 4 more years until they were ultimately victorious br br During the war Stalin used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting introducing female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy an obvious reference to Stalin himself who was always portrayed in film as a bold wise and victorious leader But Kalatozov changed this depiction as THE CRANES ARE FLYING was made after Stalins death causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm DOr as well as the Best Director and Best Actress (Tatyana Samoilova) reawakening the West to Soviet Cinema for the first time since Eisensteins IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 40s br br This film featured brilliant breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky using spectacular crane and tracking shots images of wartime battlefields Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real Another brilliant scene features the lead heroine Veronica who hasnt heard from her lover Boris in the 4 years at war so he is presumed dead but she continues to love him expressed in a scene where she runs towards a bridge with a train following behind her a moment when the viewer was wondering if she might throw herself in front of that train instead she saves a 3 yr old boy named Boris who was about to be hit by a car Another scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield who dies a senseless death and his thoughts spin and whirl in a beautiful montage of trees sky leaves all spinning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams including an imaginary wedding with Veronica This film features the famous line You can dream when the war is over In the final sequence when the war is over the soldiers are returning in a mass scene on the streets Veronica learns Boris died all are happy and excited with the soldiers return but Veronica is in despair passing out flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness revealing cranes white and gray floating in the sky br br The film was released in 1957 in Russia and according to some reviews the silence in the theater was profound the wall between art and living life had fallenand tears unlocked the doors br br  br br 
The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not admittedly all that original Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both Weve seen it many times beforebr br Nonetheless we havent seen it filmed this well with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation or destruction or hopelessness All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinemabr br I was reading Chekhovs Three Sisters the other day and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film In Act 2 Masha objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding:br br MASHA: Surely mankind must believe in something or at least seek for the truth otherwise life is just emptiness emptiness To live and not to know why the cranes are flying why children are born why there are stars in the sky Either you must know why it is you live or everything is trivial - mere pointless nonsensebr br Likewise Veronika has a hard time believing that the war and her and others sufferings have been pointless Better to assign a meaning to live as if ones life is significant and not to give in to despair It is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the filmbr br BTW as a minor correction to one other comment here--there may be a pattern of Vs in the film though I hadnt noticed them myself But the first letter of Veronikas name is not a further instance of this; in the Cyrillic alphabet her name begins with a letter which looks like an English B
Having long disdained network television programming I remember the first time I caught an episode of Police Squad! It was totally by accident It was during the shows initial network run on ABC in early 1982 I am a chronic channel surfer and was flipping the dial one evening when suddenly appeared Police Squad!s opening credit sequence on my TV screen I immediately recognized it as a sendup of the opening credits of M-Squad starring Lee Marvin one of my all-time favorite cop shows I stopped surfing Then of course came headquarters getting shot up followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln By now I was saying to myself What the heck is THIS?? Then came special guest star Georg Stanford Brown getting flattened by a plummeting safe I was hooked from that moment The episode was Ring of FearA Dangerous Assignment with its comic references to On The Waterfront and Muhammed Ali but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non sequiturs Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their loose parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of M Squad were an absolute riot Finally I said to myself A network television program truly worth watching!!! Wouldnt you know it would be canceled just a few weeks later Leave it to the networks -- I should have known Anyway I just bought the DVD collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago The Naked Gun movies were terrific as well but I really missed Alan North (he was so good as Ed Hocken) Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what were they thinking casting OJ in that part?) and especially William Duells Johnny the shoeshine guy Great stuff
Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words: Police Squad - in color you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcombr br Also to kill off a Guest Star and then never refer to him again where had you ever seen that before Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention you would miss several jokes in the background Dont pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry This was the show that video recorders were made for way before Married with Children or The Simpsonsbr br The stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before realising that it was a jokebr br The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came right out of Dragnet and they were absolutely straight (no funny accents or expressions) but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan Only once as I can remember were there a segment played for silly laughs - a scene involving a trip to a dentist suction and a whole lot of salivabr br There were some tedious moments - like the informer Johnny and an appearance by some celebrity That was strictly a one-joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes Oh well Everything cant be perfect The important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee deep in tears of laughterbr br Leslie Nielsen was fortunate that this revived his career when they put the Frank Drebin character in 3 features but it must have been an Achilles heel as well Can you remember seeing him in anything except Naked Gun type work since? And dont count the awful Mr Magoo reworked for live action He probably made a lot of money though
Two years after the success of Airplane Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great Leslie Nielsen as plain clothed detective Frank Drebin Also in the cast was Alan North as Captain Ed Hocken Ed Williams as Ted Olsen and William Duell as Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy Police Squad! featured unashamedly corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background Each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame in which the characters in frame stand completely still One of the best freeze frame sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still causing the cup to overflow! Guest stars were killed off in the opening titles one included Georg Stanford Brown being crushed by a falling safe! Despite gaining positive reviews and much critical acclaim Squad! only lasted for six episodes before being cancelled This didnt mean the end though five years later the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the Naked Gun films
I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show thanks to the many sight gags non sequitors and scripts filled with word play In one episode there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice br br But unfortunately ABC canceled the show after only six episodes I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode One that I remember was in the opening where the episodes title was different from the one shown on the screen br br Leslie Nielsens portrayal of Frank Drebin was deadpan yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet Alan North did well and Peter Lupus in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible wasnt bad as Norberg But the one character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy played by William Duell After giving advice to Drebin there were cameos from Dick Clark Dr Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda br br Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC the Zucker Brothers didnt give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise Ill close with a regular closing gag Freeze the ending right here
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1 2 & 3) this is fast-paced in your face rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses br br Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin an incompetent Detective who bumbles and fumbles his way through cases with the capable assistant of his boss Capt Ed Hockenbr br The story lines are spurious at best but its deliberate as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters br br The jokes themselves come in many forms be it wordplay slapstick puns or background gags most of them hitting the spot though some fall a little flat Its inevitable with this gag every few seconds approach that some will fail but the ratio is good br br The characters are a delight From the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of every episode the laboratory scientist who appears to be conducting cruel and unusual experiments on children to the shoe-shine who is some form of oracle the writing is witty and sharp as a cutlass br br Though not especially successful at the time it rapidly developed a cult following many blaming the shows relative lack of success on being way ahead of its time and too sophisticated for the target audience chief amongst them none other than Matt The Simpsons Groening: and he should know br br Dated by todays standards if you can see through that aspect youre in for a treat
The inspiration for the Naked Gun movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy - as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin always having to solve an absurd case Like Airplane! and the movies based on the series the humor relies on Mel Brooks-style spot gags and silly comments (namely the yes it is remarks) along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him And of course the final frame in which something keeps movingbr br Its too bad that the show only had six episodes At least it spawned the movies You cant go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in these sorts of roles I suspect that they all had fun filming it Really funnybr br Before Airplane! Leslie Nielsen had starred in movies like Forbidden Planet Harlow and The Poseidon Adventure As late as 1987 he co-starred in Nuts alongside Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss But since the first Naked Gun movie its been all comedy all the time
When I was young I was a big fan of the Naked Gun movies but just recently I watched the show Police Sqaud! and I think its great! Leslie Nielsons awesome Alan North is cool and who the heck is Rex Hamilton? But anyways its one goofy showbr br One of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits I think my favorite one is when Norberg (not OJ) walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame Classic!br br The only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old (when Drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks Cigarette? and the person replies Yes I know) I think they used it too many times by whateverbr br Good acting good gags great show!br br 710
I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams back in the early days at Comedy Central Back in those days (the 90s) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k complete with bearded hostbr br Capt Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced dead-pan filibuster Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show) boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios This is distilled 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now save it for later) Frank Drebin is clueless at most times a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable He is a master of the police investigative methodology (aka - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy) This does not make him a bad cop Cops get lucky also Capt Drebin (notice hes a Captain here) has perfected it Along with his partner Nordberg and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodesbr br The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote-ables Most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly The magic never came from the sight gagshowever At its core was a nonsensical and straight-faced conversation and activities in the foreground with crazy things occurring in the background The movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series Think of Monty Pythons And Now For Something Completely Differentbr br If you liked Airplane 1 & 2 Naked Gun 123 or Top Secret then you will definitely enjoy this br br I always liked the series better than the movies even though I saw the movies first Why? 2 words : No OJ
The creative team of Jim Abrahams David Zucker and Jerry Zucker had their roots in improvisational theatre in Madison Wisconsin I believe it was They had a group called Kentucky Fried Theatre(or something similar) They put a bunch of their set pieces onto celluloid asKENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE(1977) which was long irreverent sophomoric and really funnybr br They followed up with the very popular AIRPLANE! (1980) which really put them on the map In it they took some rather well known veteran actors in Robert Stack and (especially) Leslie Nielsen and putting them in prominent roles proceeded to parody every cliché of every aviation film since the days of John Waynes (Batjac)Production of THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (1954) Pockets stuffed with cash and now having been noticed the trio worked out a deal with Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company TV Network to do a half hour comedy spoof of the nearly countless Police Crime Drama show that have come and gone on our television screens over the years Remembering the fine job that Mr Leslie Nielsen had turned in on AIRPLANE! he was cast in the leadbr br As SgtLtCaptain Frank Drebbin (the rank designation switch being one of their comic bits)he presided over a great series of successive puns sight gags non sequitors and overblown policecrime clichésAll of these strung together by someseemingly standard scripts Added to this is overly dramatic opening narration voiced over information contradicting the visual printed info They always used this in giving the title of the episode titles where voice and printed titles never matchedbr br They had a great musical score which even though being somewhat exaggerated would have passed as theme and incidental music in a straight dramaThe musical score the opening titles and format of having the episodes divided into Act I Act II Epilogue etc were all part of obvious but affectionate ribbing of QM (Quinn Martin) Productions (They even had the same announcer as did the real QMs)br br One thing that this all too short of a series did not have was a technically augmented audience laughter And boy they sure didnt need any phony tract The nature of the spoof was such that it demanded the viewers close almost undivided attention and that proved to be the ultimate reason behind POLICE SQUADs downfallbr br In regards to the series cancellationan ABC Executive explained that the episodes called for too much attention on the part of the viewer So isnt that what one would want?br br So after only 6 wonderfully wacky hilarious episodesoff to the afterlife of series cancellation went POLICE SQUAD! only to be reborn in THE NAKED GUN trilogy made for the big screen in movie houses Once again they did quite well at the Box Office Oh well TVs loss is Cinemas gain thanks to you Mr Idiot TV Exec!br br  THE HIGH AND MIGHTY was produced by the Dukes own Batjac Productions and released by Warner Brothers It was unavailable for quite a number of years and finally Mr Waynes family made arrangements to release it to television and to video
After reading over all these reviews Im very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 NBC cop show M Squad starring Lee Marvin i read reviews comparing it to Dragnet and some of the Quinn Martin police shows but if you watch M Squad youll see it was based on it In the late 1958 episodes of M Squad onwards youll see Lee Marvin who plays Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger get out of his car and then hes shot atand he shoots back the beginning of Police Squad is basically the same ( including the Jazz music) and then Lee Marvin narrates what goes on (Im Lieutenant Detective Frank BallingerM Squada special department of the Chicago police) and in Police Squad Leslie Neilsen does the same (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin Police Squad a special division of the Police Department) and so on in one of the M Squad episodes theres even the Johnny the shoeshine guy character and in a M Squad episode entitled  More Deadly theres a Police Squad episode entitled A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise) which is the same story!
Police Squad! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon But I guess it had its run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many American television shows The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of Zucker Abrahams and Zucker Every since his straight act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE! Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian In this short lived tv series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more The bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending But Lt Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) got into so many weird cases that they have to be seen to be believedbr br Tooo bad they never released this on DVD If a show needed to be re-released it would have to be this one A whole new generation is waiting to see this show!br br Highly recommended!
The funniest show ever on TV albeit the humor is not for everyone I realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer but its a shame only six episodes were filmed The gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end when you would see Drebin and his boss Ed Hocken pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled during which the criminal (still moving) would see everyone else motionless and try to escape In another episode the building started collapsing around them as Drebin and Hocken remained in freeze modebr br Leslie Nielsen was comedic brilliance as Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show  how he managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me Because the jokes and sight gags came so often and quick you can watch the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time and catch things you missed the first time If youre like me you can watch them over and over and still find yourself laughing Even the jokes that made no sense nor seemingly had any reason to them such as the Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln tag-line in the opening announcement somehow worked  perhaps they were thrown in there precisely for that reasonbr br Cleverly spoofing the old Quinn Martin detectivecop shows of the 1970s Police Squad would return from commercial break with the words Act Two appearing on the screen which was immediately followed by Yankees One or some other quip On the opening credits the episodes title would appear on the screen but the announcer would utter a completely different title My favorite jokes and lines from this series are way too numerous to list but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks a down-on-his-luck boxer who has previously tanked fights Do you think you can beat the Champ? The boxer responds I can take him blindfolded! To which Drebin responds back But what if hes not blindfolded? A minute later in reference to the boxers small dingy apartment Drebin tells him Im going to help you get out of this sewer The next thing you see Drebin is popping up through a manhole cover on the street! In another episode Drebin and Hocken are questioning a bombing suspects flimsy alibi Drebin not believing him says Alright lets say you did go the movies After a slight pause Drebin Hocken and the suspect all look at the camera and in unison say You did go the movies A few moments later when Drebin is forced to let the suspected bomber walk free due to lack of evidence he storms away and angrily yells Tell that bomber to take off! Whats seen next is a cop giving the thumbs-up signal to a WWII-style plane on a runway right outside the building! While there were many classic Drebin quotes one particularly memorable one was Sorry to bother you Mrs Twice We would have come earlier but your husband wasnt dead then Another classic was Im a locksmith  and Im a locksmith When a visibly shaken kidnap victims father asks Drebin What I do I do?  Drebin in classic deadpan fashion responds back Well as I understand it youre in the textile business As I said the humor is not for everyone  many people simply will not get it During the shows brief run I remember the reaction being very mixed Some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things around while others thought it was the stupid and unfunny For me Police Squad even 20+ years later is the funniest thing Ive ever seen on TV For younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor but who have never seen Police Squad because they were too young when the series initially aired I highly recommend I found the six episodes to be even funnier than the subsequent Naked Gun movies
Two years after Airplane! took off Jim Abrahams Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series a glorious take-off of old US detective shows such as Dragnet Nielsen played Frank Drebin Americas answer to Inspector Clouseau It had the same style of humour as Airplane!; clever visual gags in the background unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters such as Johnny the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything Guest-stars ( including William Shatner! ) were killed off in the opening credits Police Squad was the first US sitcom since Batman to lack a laugh track Many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made but I think it was about right The concept could never have sustained a full 24-episode run Five years later Police Squad made a successful transfer to the big screen when the first of the Naked Gun trilogy was released Jim Jerry David and Leslie had the last laugh
I still count Police Squad! as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s Somewhere on BetaMax no less I have all six episodes I knew that a show this good wouldnt last and that I had to preserve it for myself How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers didnt know that Police Squad! was a comedy because it had no laugh track! Right! When Drebin has a line like You take chances just getting up in the morning driving to work or sticking your face in a fan how can THAT be comedy!?!? Ive seen every episode at least ten times and still see something new I missed before Even the deep backgrounds always have gags ongoing Dont miss it if you have chance to see an episode but if youre reading this then you probably already have copies squirreled away someplace as I do
I watched this series after I had seen the Naked Gun films I found it much better than the films and I thought the films were great! This series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun sight gag or funny situation (the all night wicker place club flamingo) I dont think Ive ever laughed as hard at a TV series in my life even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes I think its a shame that only six episodes were produced but I agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes Overall the series is a must see for those who like puns bad jokes and slapstick sight-gags
The creative team that brought us Police Squad - and the Naked Gun derived from it - said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after their delivery of the first episode Basically the show was never given any chance Typical Hollywood The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that for the show to be funny the viewer would actually need to watch it; most shows are presented on TV with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food or going to the toilet etcbr br The humor of the show is extremely dry (it uses no laugh-track) and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen regardless of logic as long as it was totally unbelievable; so for instance in one episode a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgerybr br Those familiar with the Naked Gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films In the films Nielsen developed a particular take approach - that is eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected This doesnt happen in the show where Nielsens Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected to him Also there are no romances in the show and no parodies of MTV Finally the show takes certain risks that the films avoid; in the first episode Drebin to re-enact the crime has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles - ballistics the hard way This is actually a risky bit of humor since we need to accept that its perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime for no other reason than experimentation This sort of thing rarely happens in the filmsbr br Taken individually each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the Naked Gun films since they are both more compact (more happens in a shorter time-frame) yet more leisurely paced (theres not the rush for a punch-line as sometimes happens in the films) There are some inconsistencies that happen in the films (primarily 2 and 3) that never occur in the shows shorter time-framebr br Of course theres no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema And if you watch the TV show episode after episode in one sitting the dry quality of the humor might wear away ones tolerancebr br None the less it would be useful to have a DVD of this and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - If laughter has as some claim medicinal value watching this show is good for ones health
Extremely funny More gags in each one of these episodes than in ten years of Friends And with a good (ie funny) Nordberg not the fab-only-casted OJ Simpson in the movies When will these episodes emerge on DVD?
To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all After all this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies Writing is superb Even though the show is built on one-liners they dont become overbearing or annoying Leslie Nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You aint seen nothing yet The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun When watching these movies notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show The brilliant part is that they dont have to be changed too much The show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later
One night I was listening to talk radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows br br With TV shows like MASH you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you didnt miss anything But with Police Squad you HAD to watch the show with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you didnt see them Who could forget  the part of town known as Little Italy with the coliseum in the backgroundbr br Even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags but then again being in the theater you were a captive audiencebr br Leslie also said the one reason the show movies and other movies like Airplane were funny is because they didnt attempt to tell what was funny It was up to the viewer to get the jokesbr br Well thats just my 2 cents
To be brief the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away but Gene Kelly Rita Hayworth and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air A few of the songs are terrible clunkers (Poor John is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kellys rival has to be seen to be believed Another treat is the perfect faux-NYC sets in the best Hollywood traditionbr br Another attraction if you consider such things attractions is the howlingly awful male chivalry toward women The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then (in the movies at least) is presented in its most lurid form here Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolfbr br One minor disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers--a missed opportunity
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances This typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot even for 1944 but because of the actors its still fun to watch Hayworth isnt even that much of a dancer but she has a lot of inexperienced charm that fits her character Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while Silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs The movie can also be very serious at times Not a must-see but recommended if you like the actors
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Kern and Gershwin musical numbers Following her signature role in Gilda Hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her Besides looking as gorgeous as ever she impresses with her dancing as well Gene Kelly who was on loan to Columbia from MGM matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done The supporting characters were also competently acted Personally I didnt enjoy Cover Girl as much as the musicals Hayworth made with Fred Astaire However Cover Girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend My score: 710
Im not a big fan of musicals but I was always enamored of Ms Hayworths looks so I thought Id give it a trybr br This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms Hayworth Shes never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of Gilda where she is sex symbol par excellence)br br Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers The comedy may be dated but it is still quite amusing Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances dancing with the image of himself from a windowbr br But Rita drives this whole movie An excellent cast featuring Otto Kruger and the always- wonderful wise-cracking Eve Arden doesnt hurtbr br Rita sings Rita dances all the while looking impossibly beautiful! The music may be short of classic but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite cleverbr br I find this movie works better than Gilda which I regard as a flawed film To Ms Hayworths credit she also drives Gilda and Gilda drives any red-blooded male insanebr br The film holds up well after all these years Much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus!
Although Im not crazy about musicals COVER GIRL is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly The film may be dated by todays standards and the story and songs may be nothing special but the musical numbers are magnificently staged and theres a terrific cast to go with the film Plus the film is a worthy introduction for fans of Rita Hayworthshes simply breathtaking in glorious Technicolorbr br Despite Jerome Kerns collaboration with the film his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936) yet the songs serve the film well The dancing is nothing short of excellent especially coming from Gene Kellys solo number and my favorite musical number Alter-Ego Dance The amusing Phil Silvers nearly steals the film as Kellys partner Otto Kruger Eve Arden and Edward Brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles And Rita plays a sweet charming girl here; a role thats a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941)br br All in all this is a delightful film thats worth watching even if youre not big on musicals Yet the films music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters Irving Berlin or Cole Porter wrote the songs for this film However its the glorious Technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that are the real treats of the films productionbr br While I was watching Rita Hayworth do her stuff I dont think Ive ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powells masterpiece THE RED SHOES (1948) Just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie but this a pretty good one I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how Gene got the girl My favorite part though without a doubt is Genes dance with his alter ego I love watching two Gene Kellys for the price of one It shows what talent Mr Kelly really was It is a movie that I think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time So you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today! Im sure that everyone out there has a Gene Kelly friend that has this movie in their collection So go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy!
This was Gene Kellys breakthrough and that alone makes it memorable Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser which is exactly how it turned outbr br Kelly plays Danny McGuire a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the wrong side of the tracks in 40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) Rita is lovely and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rustys grandmother Rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger) who romanced and lost Rustys grandmotherbr br The plot revolves around Danny cutting Rusty loose to the detriment of his club because she has a chance at success that he cant give her But naturally thats not what Rusty ultimately wants because as usual in films of that time the right guy is the only thing on the girls mind There are no surprises but everybody does their thing wellbr br Kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window He was the master at that sort of dance and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once The melodrama gets a bit thick and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two but Kelly takes this film to the next level This was before he became a mega-star and too smooth perhaps for his own good An underlying edge of rawness to his character lends it a believable and almost wistful airbr br Kellys character in the 1980 Xanadu also was named Danny McGuire This film was the beginning that film the end of a terrific run for a dancing genius Clearly this film meant a lot to him Highly recommended
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its glitter Although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers Rita Hayworth who happens to garner some attention when shes given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine Trouble begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town Phil Silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job Of course there is the music and the dancing One dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out He is walking along the street at night alone and he see his reflection in a shop window His reflection soon starts dancing along with him in the streets great cinematography Dont miss this one great entertainment
Long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and Cover Girl is no exception to the rulebr br A story of a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and famous The old adage applies here- that happiness and fame always dont mixbr br The dance routines are marvelously choreographed What dancing and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kellybr br Otto Kruger is the older gentleman who discovers Hayworth when he sees her picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the aisle-Hayworths grandmother Maribelbr br A jealous reaction by Kelly drives Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowmanbr br The picture is basically history repeating itself at the endbr br To add to the glory of this fine film there is the always wise-cracking Eve Arden and the hilarious Phil Silvers appropriately named Genius in the film
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals its a classic! Rita Hayworth is in top form her beauty leaps out of the screen Gene Kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph Phil Silvers is the perfect second bananas and Eve Arden injects this movie with a lot of classbr br  The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why in this era where major Broadway shows come from the movies Cover Girl hasnt been adapted to theatre
In Brooklyn the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuires owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly) Rusty Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar trying to find a pearl The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway whose owner proposes her She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style missing the love of Danny and her old friends Cover Girl is a delightful romantic comedy very naive and having magnificent parts such as the beauty and talented Rita Hayworth dancing singing and acting; Gene Kelly specially in two scenes dancing with himself and with Rusty and Genius on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars Danny the character of Gene Kelly is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing in Gilda but she is stunning in Cover Girl In accordance with the information on the cover of the VHS Cover Girl was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot giving continuity to the story instead of just being thrown in the movie My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved Cover Girl therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations My vote is ninebr br Title (Brazil): Modelos (Models)
Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun fancy and delightful musical starring Gene Kelly Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker who has dreams to be a successful Broadway star Unfortunately her career is getting no where in Danny McGuires Night Club When one of her fellow dancers says shes going to enter a Cover Girl contest she decides to follow her dreams and enters She reminds the publisher of her Grandma who he was deeply in love with many years ago But when she finds this success her boyfriend is not happy about itbr br I had never seen Rita before this and I am so glad I did! She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress There are some good numbers in here not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to One thing I didnt like was Gene Kellys character He should have supported his girlfriend! But anyway thats perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie Cover Girl is a glorious fluffy film - perfect escapism Not everyones ideal movie but a wonderful movie nonetheless due to Rita Hayworths star power Great movie truly impressed
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous Although a musical I thought Rita Hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well As far as her dancing I think she was excellent Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Ritas dancing in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dancing and lets face it Betty Grable was an excellent dancer The cinematography and vivid colors are also noted Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but shes also in love with her mentor played by Gene Kelly Does she leave Kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and Broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? Youll have to watch the film to find out!
A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth He owns a nightclub where she dances Shes no star yet but she gets a big break when shes chosen as a cover girl for Vanity whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother When he sees the resemblance he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running Hayworths newfound fame at first works wonders for Kellys club but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter This isnt the most original of plots but the two leads really make it work It also helps that the screenplay is great Kellys not yet at his peak especially his peak as an actor His dancing however wow Hayworth is the star but Kelly claims the films most memorable moment as he dances passionately with his own reflection Its obviously a take-off of Fred Astaires shadow dancing in Swing Time but I think Kelly one-ups it which is hardly believable In fact this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history save perhaps the finale of An American in Paris several years later The rest of the songs are also excellent and the musical numbers are even better Too bad Rita didnt sing her own songs (well she may have a couple of them as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes) Her dancing is wonderful as is the rest of her acting Its hard not to love her in anything Shes really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era Not plastic like many of them; no you can really see the warmth in that woman Her smile is so disarming Phil Silvers has the role as Kellys best friend and he is also very funny The trio of Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers is obviously the kernel which became the Kelly-Reynolds-OConnor trio in Singin in the Rain eight years afterwards One of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the Good Morning number in Singin I do think Singin in the Rain is the better film as Cover Girl is a little rough around the edges This roughness though just adds to the charm There are aspects of this film that beat Singin in the Rain and even An American in Paris For instance the central relationship is more emotionally involving Instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers after all) we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals There is no chasing around - an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour you have to admit Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the start and when that begins to fray I really felt it 910
This has got to be one of the better post-Astaire musicals made by Columbia Produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by vet Charles Vidor this picture really put Gene Kelly on the map and cemented Rita Hayworths reputation as cinemas premier female dance partner She plays a bit of a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with Gene and co-star Phil Silvers but also puts her in the role of her grandmother a nightclub performer in the late 19th Centrybr br The music should also be singled out because this was I believe the last project that the legendary Jerome Kern (most famous today for Old Man River and Smoke Gets in Your Eyes) worked on and his lyricist was the equally legendary Ira Gershwin They supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization The music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because its so perfectly styled in the early 20th Century idiom that was Kerns original period Its a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that timebr br The story is pretty inconsequential which is fine with me because this film is as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s40s golden age of Broadway musical comedy style on film Even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the films music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing make way for tomorrow and even humorously poke fun at Americas enemies and use period slang such as referring to gremlinsbr br Probably the most memorable performance in the film is Kellys dance to the Alter-Ego Dance which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience This prefigures much of his later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itselfbr br Fans will want to seek this out for various reasons -- Kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of MGM with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his usual MGM material Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability And fans of classic Broadway musicals will definitely want to hear Kerns final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwins lyrics and the compatibility of their styles This is a definite gem in the crown of Columbias musical program
Rita Hayworth is right there where she should be - as a Cover Girl in this 1944 Technicolor film also starring Gene Kelly Phil Silvers Eve Arden Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger Rita plays a beautiful showgirl Rusty working at a small club owned by the man she loves Danny (Kelly) Each Friday they go out for oysters with Genius (Silvers) the club comedian They all hate oysters but theyre looking for a pearl When they find one all three of them will have good luck they believebr br Rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner (Kruger) sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved who turns out to be Rustys grandmother Once she becomes the cover girl the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true Danny wants her to have her success but at the same time realizes hes lost herbr br Cover Girl has exuberant dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears Rita is at her best playing both Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past For such a sexy desirable gorgeous woman she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men None of this ever showed on screen nor did the fact that she didnt want to be a movie star She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life Gene Kelly is in a serious role here but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing Phil Silvers is very amiable and funny as the in-house comic and best friendbr br This is a very good movie with no dull spots The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg who plays herself in the film speaks of getting married shes warned by her boss not to that shes too necessary to the modeling business Were not told if Rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at Dannys - but all signs seemed to point toward the Brooklyn club Why couldnt she have had both? Nevertheless you cant beat Cover Girl for top entertainment beautiful color lovely music great energy fine performances and its most fabulous asset the glorious Rita Hayworth
This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s The glorious Technicolor shows off Rita Hayworths beauty and spectacular hair She should have made more movies in color but then Columbia was hardly in a position to splash out money for Technicolor spectacularsbr br Rita is a WOW as Rusty Parker - she more than keeps up with Gene in some of the most sparkling numbers ever She also looked beautiful in turn of the century gowns so she was given a chance to play her own grandmotherbr br The film opens with The Show Must Go On - it looks great to me - but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed His motto is work work work!!! One of the dancers Maurine (Lesley Brookes) is determined to better herself and is going to audition for Vanitys Golden Wedding Cover Girl Competition Rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions as well In a very funny scene Maurine has just had a so so audition and seeing Rusty gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges!!! Dont be shy and demure - chatter and sparkle Rusty does so with gusto!!!br br They decide on Maurine and go to the show to see her but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past Cornelia (Eve Arden) is still having nightmares over Rustys audition Whose Complaining features Genius (Phil Silvers) and the dancers dressed up as working girls - (Rusty is a cabbie)br br John is remembering a long lost love (Rustys grandmother Maribelle Hicks) the first time he saw her singing A Sure Thing - set at the races Meanwhile Danny Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local diner They then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - Make Way For Tomorrowbr br Put Me to the Test is a spirited song and dance number featuring Danny and Rusty In the meantime Rusty has been chosen Cover Girl and Danny McGuires is the place to be seen Lee Bowman appears as Dannys romantic rival and puts a damper on things Lee Bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever - so Danny never needs to worrybr br Rusty (dubbed by Martha Mears) sings Long Ago and Far Away and it is danced beautifully by Danny and Rusty The gowns that Rita wears are stunning Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling designed them Danny wants the best for Rusty but is afraid he will lose her Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the Alter Ego number where he dances with himselfbr br Poor John is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations - Hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit Look for Al Norman in both Poor John and A Sure Thing He was an amazing eccentric dancer who appeared in several early musicals including King of Jazz and Paramount on Parade He was easy to spotbr br The Cover Girl dance is just wonderful Rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer After a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of Americas top magazines Rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy Cover Girl song Gosh I just LOVE this movie!!!!br br Highly Recommended
This is a very enjoyable fluffy glamorous musical from the 40s Cover Girl made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) into a bona-fide all-American star It confirmed Gene Kellys amazing talent as a dancer singer actor and choreographer It epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genrebr br Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker- it is her picture and her presence is always at the forefront Her singing is dubbed but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly I think that Rita was highly underrated as an actress- she plays every scene superbly here Gene choreographed the dance sequences (he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here) and his Alter Ego dance number is amazing Such artistry The stand-out tunes are Make Way For Tomorrow Put Me To The Test and of course Long Ago and Far Away The plot is rather thin yet it does have a moral Its about the perils of quick fame and fast money and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed This will cheer you up lift you up to your feet and make you laughbr br That said Cover Girl is not the greatest musical ever produced- it has a number of flaws that must be addressed One can say that a little bit of Phil Silvers goes a long way His character gets tedious rather quickly However I was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with Gene and Rita Another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great The Cover Girl number looks fantastic but Im not a fan of the lyrics or the singing Poor Tom is a huge downer I think its one of the worst numbers Ive heard in a 40s-50s musical yet It stinks The grandmother sub-plot borders on being ridiculous But thats only my opinion Others may like these elementsbr br Still apart from its faults its a very very good film much better than most of the product churned out today The dancing and singing is sublime the production values are excellent and its mood is infectiousbr br 810
This is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Vidor Rita Hayworth (Rusty Parker)Charlie Chan in Egypt sang and danced with Gene Kelly(Danny McGuire) Anchors Away Danny McGuire owned a night club in Brooklyn NY and was in love with Rusty Parker who was a dancer in his club along with Phil Silvers(Genius)Coney Island who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with Danny Rusty Otto Kruger (John Coudair)Duel in the Sun played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided Rusty Parker was going to be his top model Jerome Kerns music is heard through out the entire picture and the song Long Ago & Far Away is the theme music for this musical This film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during WW II which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant hits and their careers exploded on the silver screen for many many years Great Musical and a film you will not want to miss this is truly a great Classic Film Enjoy
Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour--shes one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuires club the most special one according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her Take for example Vanity magazine magnate John Coudair (Otto Kruger): enchanted by Rustys resemblance to her grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks) whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle He doesnt believe that Danny could give Rusty happiness or everything she should be entitled to--he even gets Danny believing this himself When Rusty shoots to fame as Vanitys Cover Girl Danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman) So what happens when Danny returns to town with his sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers) in tow only to discover that Rusty is marrying Wheaton?br br As a musical COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin including the Oscar-nominated Long Ago and Far Away (possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully sweetly sung as a duet by Hayworth and Kelly) Maribelles number Sure Thing (the more lacklustre Poor John isnt a KernGershwin collaboration) and Put Me To The Test The dancing of course is top-notch since Gene Kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography It shows in the simplest of dances for example his dance with Hayworth to Put Me To The Test or the joyfully exuberant Make Way For Tomorrow number (performed by the trio of Danny Rusty and Genius) which foreshadows the reaction Genes character has to the police cop in the title number in SINGIN IN THE RAIN Kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the Alter-Ego dance Like its successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively) this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity Kelly brought to the modern film musical: wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldnt be showcased on a stage and years before CGI Kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style--himself The number is hardly five minutes long but it (and Kellys genius) still takes ones breath away even sixty years down the line This is the reason I watched COVER GIRL and if nothing else this dance is truly worth itbr br You can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth--not that she doesnt deserve it Witness the scene when Rusty hits Broadway--the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for Rustys entrance Hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of Kelly (Very few of Kellys co-stars have that honour) She is hilarious in some scenes for example her drunk scene when John and Wheaton come to get her from Joesbr br For some reason however her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity That curse is only lifted whenever Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or no) or when Eve Arden as Johns long-suffering secretary Stonewall sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation Since the film in the end belongs to Hayworth neither Kelly nor Arden can save it as a whole This isnt to say that the film is bad--it isnt Its enjoyable with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at But its just not quite a classic The dancing is classic though--so watch COVER GIRL for that and you wont regret it
Cover Girl is the best musical Rita Hayworth ever made Ms Hayworth will always be remembered for Gilda however the next movie would be Cover Girl The story is great It is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business She does it without the help of her talented dancerdirector boyfriend (Gene Kelly) Mr Kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers The dances are spectacular It is fun to see Phil Silvers a comic do the musical numbers with Ms Hayworth and Mr Kelly br br The supporting cast is perfect Lee Bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel the other boyfriend
A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers) Rusty is in love with Danny All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them) The story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing The movie has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and Is less really more if you are happy? Answering those questions makes the movie The movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had Never a dull moment!
It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kellys home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworths signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War IIbr br Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where Rita is a featured dancer and Phil Silvers the comic Of course Kelly does a bit of hoofing himself therebr br Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworths grandmother In some flashback sequences from the gaslight era Hayworth also plays her own grandmother with Jess Barker playing the young Kruger You might remember Jess Barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead Susan Haywardbr br Broadway producer Lee Bowman also is attracted to Hayward but hes not interested in nostalgia He wants her for his Ziegfeld Follies revue and in fact the biggest number of Cover Girl is the title song of the film Its nicely done in Follies stylebr br Hayworth also gets to sing A Sure Thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin Hayworth also does an old English music hall number Poor John When I say sing as everyone knows Rita mouths words Singing here is done by Nan Wynnbr br The biggest hit of the show is Long Ago and Far Away which is introduced by Gene Kelly It was one of the biggest hits of the World War II era and one of the biggest sellers Jerome Kern ever wrote It happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this September Long Ago and Far Away was nominated for Best Song but lost to Swinging on a Starbr br What really sets Cover Girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for Gene Kelly is the two numbers Put Me to the Test and the Alter Ego number Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B Mayer had refused at MGM to give Kelly creative control of his own material Kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate br br In fact after one more loan out film Christmas Holiday at Universal Louis B Mayer never loaned out Gene Kelly for the rest of the time he was at MGM And he did get creative control from then onbr br With that dazzling technicolor cinematography and Ritas red hair and Gene Kellys boundless creativity Cover Girl was and is a classic and will forever be so
When I saw this film it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had (mostly filled with robots)br br I can relate to Eledores problems and I have a similarity to Shiro and this is a great film to watch (if youre a Goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!) All in all watch it before its out of print!
I just re-watched 08th MS Gundam for the 2nd time It is so much better than Gundam Wing I cant wait to get the DVD and see what was edited out of the series This is great to see the Gundams actually move about clumsily through the land Somebody really thought over writing this move scriptbr br See this today
The 08th MS team features two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict Aina the Zeon officer and Shiro the Federal Forces new pilot meet in a battle in space throughout the 12 episode series (and one movie) the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them It features a Romeo and Juliet romance and unbeatable animation By far one of the best to hit American Shores Suit Up!
This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory The story takes place during the same time line as the original Gundam in the year UC 0079 the time of the One year war but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate The Hero of the story is a young Lt Shiro Amada who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effortbr br His life get complicated when he meets Aina Sahalin a Jion ace pilot (the enemy) the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them The other cast of characters in the story are not there for background either every one in this story has a history to thembr br There is also another Ace mobile suit pilot in this series that can be added into the pantheon of ace mobile suit pilots Right up there with Char Aznable and Anavel Gato is Norris Packard not the top villain in this series but his presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight 3 of them against Norris and his single MS-07B Gouf custom mobile suitbr br In conclusion This Gundam along with Stardust Memory is a must see!!br br 
Watched this film at a local festival the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida  What a lovely film A simple uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions It neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change I wasnt embarrassed by any of the film content or language A real family film and the best British comedy film Ive seen since Billy ElliotThe film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of Best Film and Best Director Ten out of ten
Logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film Love Love is and am totally confused Seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up Plastic demon baby what? This wasnt Love Life A little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great funny and original film Especially liked the ending that didnt fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it Nine out of ten
I watched Love Life on holiday when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida It was a lovely surprise to find a British film that wasnt derivative or exploitive A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film The transitions between scenes I found a bit distracting but as whole I think Love Life is a winner a ruby in the dust One for all the family A pleasant change to see a British film for teen audiences that isnt littered with four letter words Try and see it
Wow! Why arent more British movies like this Great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances The comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great One to hunt down and watch Look out for it! Ten out of ten
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film
Its just one of those films youre either love it or hate it my girlfriend and me loved it told my brother to rent it and he hated it said it was too flashy and colloquial then again he only usually goes to see big action movies so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed There were some great new talent (Id never heard of the leads before anyway)? Des Brady (the directors brother?) was especially good Playing a right dick at the start I thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end I was really routing for him A very surprising film with a whole lot of heart if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original Yashimo Brixton in the UK
We really liked this movie It wasnt trying to be outrageous controversial clever or profound It was just entertaining and was what it said on the box a charming romantic comedy Every other Brit film maker seems to want to change the world nice to see one that just concentrates on telling a good yarn with elegant style
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week Never heard of the film-maker before or his other films (thank you IMDB) About time some one made a good young British comedy that didnt star Hugh Grant or forty somethings The story is a morality tale but never preachy throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast Luke Gosss cameo was surprisingly very good but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in Blade Loved the colour grading especially in the night club sequences Great music and a truly original voice at work here Nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge
A vg Brit rom-com one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy Quirky and often surprising this is not the best of Bradys films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest) though it does have a unique charm Well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high You know from the start how its going to end but when it comes it is honest and very open ended a realistic and credible ending the end seemed like a beginning enjoyable and left me wanting more
Inherited this from my xs DVD collection when he left with my best friend (enough said) watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly (nothing new there then) and got a very pleasant surprise Very British (you no hardly any budget no faces you know or have even seen before) the accents were a bit thick for my liking but after a worrying start (a bit too close to home in my case) it began to grow on me Apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didnt add anything I found the film throughly uplifting very real natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon Highly recommended!
After having seen The Lost Child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995 and having read the readers comments (mostly about Jane Tennisons background and Helen Mirrens superb role in it) it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role Robert Glenister is playing as Chris Hughes Even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser carrying the weight of his own pastWatching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of his actions I have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her Praise for Robert Glenister!
Im surprised that mine so far is the only comment on this tv movieas far as Im aware the series itself has had a huge following reviewer pundits and real people alike have praised it to a person Anyway let me tell you right away that if like me youre a sucker for gritty police dramas youll like The Lost Child Tennison the heroine throughout the Prime Suspectseries has been battling the male police establishment throughout the series getting to her present comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard workobstinacy and sheer talent for police work She isessentially an ambitious career woman but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man-hater Unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours which her career demands and she has never married so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and jeopardising her entire police job let alone future advancement or having an abortion - which she opts for This abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama - its very skilfully dealt with in less than a couple of minutes screentime a marvel of economy in scripting and editing - but its always there as a counterpoint to Tennisons desperate efforts to find another lost child - a kidnap victim - before its too late The story takes many twists and turnsbefore the surprise ending and one is fascinated alike by the plot and characters (although I found the many villains a little overdrawn) the police and especially Tennison herself are not always competent nor that likeable which figures given the unpleasant job that they have to do in the sleazy underworld which this series habitually inhabitsbr br Mirren herself has said that shell make no more movies in the series but excellent as shes always been in the role of Tennison the series itself is as actor proof as is another addiction of mine -Dick Wolfs AmericanLaw & Order - whoever appears therein each could go on forever As is my fervent hope
Prime Suspect 4 continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4 PS5 & PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age loneliness indiscretions a host of personal and professional problems and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal PS4 conjures two stories while PS5 & PS6 are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good In other words to prevail Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces something which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series yet grayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers Very good stuff which only gets better from series to series (B+)
As the superb Prime Suspect series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all this in itself a considerable achievement Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these British dramas but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren easily dominates; our eyes never leave her while shes on-screenbr br The search for the lost child of the title leads Superintendent Jane Tennisons CID team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters The insight we are given into the workings of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series but it may be too strong for many stomachsbr br The action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand-held camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and theres gripping tension during the climactic siegebr br Altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama
The third entry in the Stepford franchise but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down whereas the 70s original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular I havent seen either the early 80s Revenge of the Stepford Wives or the mid 90s The Stepford Husbands but this The Stepford Children is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film Its basically the exact same film as the original; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80s to the nth degree The main difference here like the title implies is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective Stepford treatment licensed by the local Mens Association For some reason the scenario attempts to uphold the Stepford mystery until late in the film even though nobody is likely to watch this sequel before having checked out the original and presumably everybody also knows about the denouement The Harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford Particularly father Steven is excited about their new life because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to go back ever since his first wife whom his new wife Laura and adolescent children Mary and David know very little about died under mysterious circumstances The town is almost too perfect with picturesque neighbors and model students and especially the modern teenagers face huge difficulties to adjust Their efforts to modernize the place and take the local youth of Stanford in tow cause confrontations with the eminent townsfolk particularly the members of the Mens Association and put the familial relationships under a lot of stress David meets and falls in love with the last normal girl in school Lois but when even she transforms into a domestic dummy overnight David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister Stanford secret The first hour of The Stanford Children is slow-paced and rather tame but the finale is trashy and cheesy like the VHS cover promises and like a late 80s thriller ought to be in fact The modus operandi behind the Stanford secrets is illustrated in greater detail and I think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate that At least I did The overall plot still doesnt make a lot of sense and the script is chock-full of irrational aspects but its nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear The acting performances are far above average Especially the arrogant and obnoxious members of the Mens Association depict plausible characters and even teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff give away impressive performances Recommended without hesitation!
The Stepford Children besides being a very good made for TV movie shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination It is quite a statement about how being made to act within the confines of what is considered Good behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual I think that this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some semblance of the thought that loams within the hearts and minds of youngsters should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying I dont know if that was in any way the intent of this movie but I have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best movie devices against the wish to have children conform to an unrealistic and domineering pretense of what is in the best interest of anyone other than that of the children themselves I hope to one day see this movie on DVD I am at the starting gate waiting
You may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to The Stepford Wifes but this is an absolute classic Much scarier in premise than the first and very entertaining It only got a video release here in the UK but should be released worldwide for everyone to enjoy
The Stepford Children is the second best Stepford movie in the Stepford seriesI saw the original The Stepford Wives in the theater when it came out in 1975I was absolutely blown awayit was terrificI have seen all of the Stepford movies and I like all of themI think that The Stepford Children is such a campy and fun movieI just watched it again recently on tape and I enjoyed it immenselyThe cast in this movie was real good to watch Barbara Eden did a bang up job as usualEvery role that she has ever played has been very goodBarbara Eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurturing type of personDon Murray as the husband and father was just perfect in this movieHe was particularly effective at being the irritated father to his two teenage childrenI made sure that I have all of the Stepford movie on tape to enjoyIf you get a chance to see this movie you should
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday since it originally played on USA networks Does Anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again I dont think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about people only know of the Stepford wives and Stepford husband movies No one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version Maybe they should also do a re-make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thrillerhorror flicks Well if anyone has any input Please I Beg Of You write me with information Thanks Taira tcampo23@aolcom
I was half-dozing as I watched a late night selection of short films--but sat bolt upright from the first frames of I Shout Love and could not take my eyes away for its full brief perfect length With incredibly assured pacing and performances this film maintains its funnysadinsightful tone throughout The credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type I had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work What a pleasing surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley a major actress who is too seldom seenbr br Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) turn in rich touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up As they work through a reprise of Tessas favorite moments from their time together both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents--and to the directorwriters skills The film creates a moving narrative with laugh-out-loud moments and caught-breath sorrowbr br I Shout Love is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films I ever expect to see It has wit heart and stunning originality It matters
So real and surreal all in one I remember feeling like Tessa Heck I remember being Tessa This was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending I especially liked the protesters tangent It is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it If you get the chance to see this take it It is well worth the 30 minutes
This is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere weve all been: a relationship as its about to end Kristen Thomsons performance as Tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with Bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story Who hasnt been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully Just one more night! When he does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one - whether permanent or not - should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away
In moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win I loved how the Maple Leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa The acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industrybr br Great editing! At the end of the short I felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiecebr br Excuse me while I rinse off the cheese whiz but I guess its acceptable at certain timesbr br Two scenes which I must point out are: The bath tub and the couch scenebr br The couch scene for Tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition Throughout the short I viewed her as a brute but now we see her true reality Her mind spoke before her heart Need I say more about the bath tub scene
At the beginning of this film which I found myself watching on IFC in the wee hours of the morning I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort The feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that I didnt know if I wanted to continue watchingalthough it didnt really seem to me that I had much of a choice so compelling was the situationbr br Gradually though that feeling of discomfort waned (although it never really disappeared entirely) and I felt drawn into Tessa & Bobbys predicaments and really just hoping against hope that they might get back togetherbr br Really just a moving powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia so now I love it even morebr br I definitely recommend it If your lucky enough to catch it on the Independent Film Channel sometime or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it
Excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair Then again the point of the film to paraphrase another comment is that every relationship can be unique and intimate A truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch fixed and quiet for the duration Bobby and Tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise Beyond that the film within a film idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting though in a somewhat melancholic way

Hark At Barker and the Doctor series It was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role in London Weekend Televisions The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs written by Richard Laing & Bernard McKennabr br Edgar Briggs is a secret agent of the SIS (Secret Intelligence Service) He genuinely tries to do his job well but always seems to mess things up Astonishingly enough though he always succeeds in getting to the bottom of cases much to the amazement of his colleagues- Buxton (Michael Stainton) Spencer (Mark Eden) and Cathy (the lovely Elisabeth Counsell) all of which answer to The Commander (Noel Coleman)br br Briggs is married to Jennifer (Barbara Angell) a woman who much like Michele Dotrices Betty from Some Mothers Do Ave Em! has the patience of a saint and stands by her hare-brained (but well-meaning) husband no matter whatbr br Like Some Mothers Do Ave Em and The Baldy Man TTSLOEB was laced completely with slapstick Each episode saw Jason perform stunts such as plummeting from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating his flat It was custard pie in the face stuff reallybr br Edgar Briggs was not a big hit due to poor scheduling from ITV A shame as it was an amusing and enjoyable show well served by its star and the fine support cast The leading man though did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show David Jason vetoed repeat screenings of the show because he felt his acting in it was non-refined Granted the David Jason who played Del Boy Inspector Frost and Pop Larkin is way different to the one that played Briggs but by no means was his acting unrefined Most actors would have turned Briggs into a ridiculous caricature but Jasons performance made Briggs a credible realistic figure Odd perhaps but not unimaginablebr br Jasons next vehicle was Lucky Feller in which he played mummys boy Shorty Mempstead It too failed to make the ratings His lucky break came in the shape of ATVs A Sharp Intake Of Breath in which he played walking disaster area Peter Barnes for four series between 1977-1981 So while not outstanding as such Briggs is an easy and worthwhile watch Nice James Bond style theme tune too!
With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses this was in my opinion David Jasons finest seriesbr br Coming straight after his TV debut on Do Not Adjust Your Set! these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days By comparison Porridge Open All Hours and that awful series Lucky Man did not come closebr br I believe Jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his rawest Shame on him A new generation deserves to enjoy this The series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against The Brothers which aired on BBC at the same time before VCRs were commonplacebr br BTW I have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant Spencer was played by Mark Eden ; Alan Bradley off Coronation Street I am amazed he didnt try to murder Edgar Briggs!!!!
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going to the pub It was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time It is one of the best comedies I have ever watched if not the best David Jason was brilliant and was compared many times to Buster Keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to watch again He had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions He is an accomplished Trip and fall guy and I remember watching a trailer once where he showed people how to do this professionally Certainly he is the one to teach people this art He only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did Pshaw this program shows how multi talented he is I am lost as to why David Jason vetoed another series being made as for my mind it was one of the best things he has ever done and Ive been a fan of his since he did this series It is said he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career Well to my mind that might possibly have been the right decision when he took it but now his career has progressed so far I believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his secret life full of blunders that he does not see Rod
Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is Everyone out there will like it! Sandwiched between the amount of breast shots the times Jacqueline rubs herself the various times Jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the Magdelena Mountains this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to endbr br Unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples this one takes awhile to guzzle The performing is good Other than great acting by Dan the pizza delivery guy (must see) there are no standouts but no notably bad outcroppings from my recent dinner either (and I do mean recent) Excellent acting overall because there are no typically dreadful actors which youd find in movies of the four Skin related data fields or in the biological skimmers found in any IBM shop In addition if you see a female in this movie the likelihood is that she will be butt naked by the next scene! Now that I think about it there is quite a bit of action in this movie Between the first and the second electro yank obtained from a hot chick and the time you observe her buckets naked keeps em speculating I loved it!
Anyone who critiques Jacqueline Hyde as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that its intended to be is just not playing with a full deck Just from the title its obvious that this low budget horror comedy isnt meant to be taken seriously its as tongue in cheek as a nymphos french kiss and just as titillating The female cast members are all great and fun to watch Check this out Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror Unlike most soft-core horror flicks this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses The movie doesnt even attempt to follow the storyline of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic but instead seeks out every way possible to create risqué sight gags and erotic situations Blythe Metz the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier homicidal side of Jacqueline is a real knockout Watch and enjoy!
One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was funexciting for the cast and crew; I could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved br br I tend to like B movies that are original and have heart and I think this is one such work The actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual maybe because of some good direction from the lead actressdirector and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent watchable piece of art br br The critiques of this film that more or less say why not just rent a hardcore porn movie make the point as to why they didnt like the film Going to this film hoping for a lot of T&A without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them One could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie even though I take it the star has done her share of soft porn I think she graduated br br In terms of the writing the dialog is not a huge part of the movie like in a Tarentino film but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun Particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure with the villianessheroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings br br I understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this Hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride br br Gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot not just airhead bimbos so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art even with the limits of B-movie land not disappointing
I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie But I was surprised to find it entertaining interesting and funny Its an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film There were moments that made my hairs stand up! Even better though were the highly amusing occasionally hysterical comedic moments in the film (youll know which ones Im talking about) There also are a few great special effects (and the humor and the special effects arent necessarily separate)br br The acting on the whole is very good--way better than a typical low budget horror film The lead (Jackie) in particular and many of the smaller supporting roles (like the lawyer the couple living next door the pizza man) are well acted If they hadnt been the film wouldnt have kept my interest and I would have lost my belief in the story This is a good interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental!
Breathtaking at its best intriguing at its worst Francis Ford Coppalas groundbreaking epic Apocalypse Now is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century and in my opinion the greatest ever film depiction centered around Americas involvement in Vietnambr br What I like most about Apocalypse Now is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre Growing up as movie buff and with a particular interest in war films Ive seen many films which have attempted to portray the images and feelings of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so Films such as Hamburger Hill and We were soldiers fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by depicting heroic battles which are more often than not tainted by the zeal of Hollywood film productionbr br In Apocalypse now there are no battles no heroes or villains there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of Vietnam through the physical aspects of war Rather it is a film which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute horror of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous centurybr br The sheer brilliance of the acting (in particular the interpretation of taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen) along with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Phillipines) which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film makes Apocalypse Now an unforgettable epicbr br Evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation Apocalypse now is not for the light-hearted moviegoer It is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated
This is a classic war movie One of the best a stark image fest of flashing lights harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans A star-studded spectacle of immense powerbr br Martin Sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great Marlon Brando Also along for the ride are Robert Duvall as an over the top DI with a penchant for napalm in the morning or at least the smell of it Dennis Hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about his leader Also in this amazing film youll see up and coming stars such as Laurence Fishburne R Lee Ermey Sam Bottoms Albert Hall and keep an eye out for Harrison Ford toobr br Behind the lens is Francis Ford Coppolla delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed Godfather films he highlights war in its most basic form which for the most part is something you cant see you can only feel it as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable The feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers Honestly no films has ever made me feel like thatbr br Criticism is hard to find The biggest qualm from some is that Brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role but in all fairness this is unjustified It was money well earned a role that physically restricted him being at the time an unwell man and a role that he really made his own I cant picture anyone better for the role And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version theres some extra bits of the great man and I think the Redux does make the film miles betterbr br Final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the Redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage If not then still you wont be disappointed this film is up there with the best and deserves some great recognition and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made
This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world The social criticism of our shallow commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the war is hell cliché underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel whos left behind the armys concepts of justice to create his own world When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980 I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece In particular I found the final segment of the journey with Brando which encapsulates Conrads Heart of Darkness to be rather boring I finally got around to seeing Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws have been taken care of Redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece certainly among the top 100 films ever made Brandos performance now seems full and complete perhaps rather less mysterious but much more profound Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled Its great to spot a young Harrison Ford Scott Glenn etc in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as The work of Robert Duvall Fred Forrest Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage If youve never seen this film skip the original and head straight for Redux I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece
I would like to submit the following goofbr br During the bridge scene soldiers are seen wading out in the river asking to be taken away and seeking to escape Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willards boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone They have duffel bags packs and footlockers but not suitcases The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping Additionally if you look closely you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water This is probably a very good indication that it is emptyotherwise it would sink
It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz(I dont say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary Hearts of Darkness I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality) The tone of voice Im talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: Everybody gets what he wants I wanted a mission and for my sins they gave me one They sent it up with room service It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating A good example of is Hoppers indulgence into aphoristic madness generously installing lines written by TS Eliot and Rudyard Kipling into his stony monologues: I mean the mans a geniussometimes hell walk right by you without even saying a word and sometimes hell grab you by the collar and say did you know that if is the middle word in lifeif you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs and then I mean hes a wise man hes a great man; I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas (The first ones Kipling the second ones Eliot
You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed Or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of judgement); that layer is completely uninterestingbr br Or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of Duvalls one-liners but thats just a coating for commercial masticationbr br You can try to view this as a realistic Vietnam war film but ask any veteran and hell swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinksbr br Or view it as a will he or wont he morality play -- nothing rich there eitherbr br Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference Coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing a great manbr br Brando the man was as much of a maverick as the Kurtz character The studios were uncomfortable with his acting method yet he always excelled and won accolades; the generals are uncomfortable with Kurtzs unsound methods in spite of his strategic geniusbr br So Coppola makes a movie all about Brandos greatness To hammer on the point he places himself in the movie (as Hopper a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises Brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actors power And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation Oh yes: the horror br br Other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives including being in the firefight long before Private Ryan; the ground breaking use of sound notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid tripbr br Dont get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound vision and self-reference
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie I mean you just have to love Robert Duval  Marlon Brando  Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval I can not believe that Kramer vs Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed Now I just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate How insane the world is and the power of will and friendship love and passion A must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever! Many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this!!
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff One of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as:br br Kilgore: If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain then its safe to surf this beach!br br Kilgore: Smell that? You smell that? Lance: What? Kilgore: Napalm son Nothing in the world smells like that Kilgore: I love the smell of napalm in the morning You know one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours When it was all over I walked up We didnt find one of em not one stinkin dink body The smell you know that gasoline smell the whole hill Smelled like victory Someday this wars gonna end
Its that film that loads of people hail as a classic - Apocalypse Now now a re-cut re-up Redux 22 years after its original releasebr br The film is loosely based on Conrads Heart of Darkness its main plot (if it has one) being Capt Willards journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets and he tells the Colonels story along the waybr br My initial feelings towards the film is that its not particularly gripping at times especially early on but at least a good dose of comedy is put in in the form of surfing fanatic Col Kilgore As the film progresses however a good deal of tension is built up with Willards reading through various reports on Col Kurtz until the end is in sight when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the endbr br The usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional and I found the performances of Martin Sheen Marlon Brando Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all be worthy of a special mention The score I found initially sounded out of place but as the film progressed Im not entirely sure if it did actually get better or it fitted better or if it had just grown on me but by the end of the film I was thoroughly enjoying itbr br This is the second time I have seen the Redux version (I have seen the original around four times) Ill say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed I was expecting a classic film with lots of war The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didnt carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that IS the film seemed unnecessary This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot) in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully (as with all films that are more character than plot based) as the second time around you know where the plot is going I had a similar experience with Its A Wonderful Life which is now one of my favourite filmsbr br With the big four Vietnam films Apocalypse Now wins over the rest on atmosphere but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter and cannot really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favourite of the four) Apocalypse Now is a great piece of work especially towards the end where it becomes staggering and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesnt mind some casual violence
First of all I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrads Heart Of Darkness the book that was the literary basis for the movie With that said I believe that this movie is astounding It is an excellent war film that doesnt so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict but more the psychological toll that it took on the young inexperienced kids who were sent to fight it Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making using many visuals to help tell the story The acting I felt was definitely all-around up to par Marlon Brandos part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film reels you in and reveals the hollowness of a man that youve heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie Those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all In my opinion this is one of the most sculptured and best-made films of all time
Francis Ford Coppolas masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance open-mindness and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had I am not a historian but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes the racial struggles the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture the increase of violence and death in the streets) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare be different and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures Coppolas film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making following the parameters of war and adventure films and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life the reason of death or the ethics of war It is also a passionate work made against all odds chronicled in the 1991 documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously The Deer Hunter and Coming Home or in latter ones as Platoon and Casualties of War before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre as horror in Jacobs Ladder or comedies as Good Morning Vietnam among the more respectable Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war
I decided I need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film Unlike other war films that focus on the event Apocalypse Now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip The sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable yet you cant lay your eyes off of it Based off of Joseph Conrads Heart Of Darkness Apocalypse Now slowly descends its protagonist Willard (Martin Sheen) into madness most likely the same way Kurtz plunged into insanity The production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for Brandos unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards) There is a documentary titled Apocalypse Now: A filmmakers Apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making thisbr br The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film As the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees the song The End by the Doors can be heard The next shot is of Willard in his bed with the fan on so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan We are informed that he does special missions for the military mostly assassinations When his next mission is given to him he is baffled Charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the Indy 500 The man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people Kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped Willard does not go alone however He is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles Along the way they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore Hoorah about the war Willard ponders that if Kilgore is that crazy what could Kurtz be like There are many scenes that portray Willards plunge into insanity: The tiger attack the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese the nonstop rain the piled dead bodies scattered about and the deaths of his crew members When he reaches the Kurtz compound he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) Instead of assassinating Kurtz right away Willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do Kurtz on the other hand wants to die He is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier Willard kills him with a machete while in unison a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people Once they realize their leader has been slain instead of killing Willard they hail him as their new king Willard rejects the offer and leaves thembr br The cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking The colors are grain free something that is rare in older movies I can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenerybr br The acting ensemble is terrific with everyone playing their parts well Many criticize Brando for some reason but I think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the warbr br The soundtrack and the score are haunting and provide the mood for the film I am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll? There have been many parodies of this film but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot: Your character provides comic relief for the show like um Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now Those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious
I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppolas masterpiece I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981 as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art especially his portrayal of the young Captain This is without a doubt a must see a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History Charlie Dont Surf Robert Duvalls famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks
Even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacobs Ladder The Deer Hunter Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver to an extent) one feels that we dont even know the half of what happened Even contemplating the horror feels inhuman And a progression - or retreat? - to the inhumanity that it necessitates is a key part of Apocalypse Now Coppolas greatest and one of the most important films ever made Loosely based on Joseph Conrads 1902 classic Heart of Darkness which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization - a surfacing of a bestial nature as it were a la Lord of the Flies - it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam The story is of Willard a general commissioned on a special mission to Cambodia after his first tour of duty in Vietnam is served Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon psychologically unable to go back home - eerily echoing Nicky in The Deer Hunter So he is contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who has isolated himself in a remote outpost on the Nung River and who has purportedly gone completely insane - worshiped like a god by the natives and killing indiscriminately This mans name is Colonel Kurtz played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best being Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire) As Willard journeys upriver in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying his witnessing the horrors and the insanity - and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all - leads to an eerie sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet By the time they do Kurtzs methods dont really seem as wrong or as they should and they certainly dont seem too unusual or out-of-place Apocalypse - a place beyond morality the outpost on the end of the world The loss of civilization the loss of judgement of self Kurtzs monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a Green Beret and his later revelation is one of the most chilling and well-delivered speeches in cinema history The film is about trauma about the human spirit and its breaking point - here its a lot like The Deer Hunter and just as good Apocalypse however takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level - Coppolas sweeping footage of the humid murky jungles of Cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky - set to an oddly fitting Doors soundtrack - as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with Wagner blasting from speakers (a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling darkly humorous and strikingly pointless war scenes ever) - this all contributes to the sense of Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future but Apocalypse Now and forever The Deer Hunter is much more up close and personal you can even tell by the title and shows the totalling effect trauma has on the individual psyche the breaking down of the human soul and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness or to limp on This is why both films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing In Heart of Darkness Kurtz is shown as conflicted between morality (civilization) and his inner savage In Apocalypse Now Kurtz has left all conflict behind He is beyond good and evil He has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before his death Kurtz indeed is only waiting for death quoting T S Eliot in his temple to himself lost in the jungle His last words and the words echoed at the end of the movie are The horrorthe horror He is referring to the infinite void of existence of the human psyche and to the pitch black emptiness within his own mind where atrocities are born again It is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film - the experience in short that Willard experiences on his journey The end part at the outpost almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in The Deer Hunter is one of the most deeply calmly and seductively disturbing things Ive ever seen
Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs and those that challenge them This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like The Longest Day and The Green Berets which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison The Apocalypse Now! project the production and resulting film is Heart of Darkness updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve This is the plight of Joseph Conrads original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliots The Hollow Men (Mistah Kurtz he dead) of 1925 Although neither a straight telling of Conrads Heart of Darkness (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience Apocalypse Now! stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential Apocalypse is not just about the horrors of war per se like Platoon and The Deer Hunter but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experiencedbr br The bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance) aboard a US military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerners would ever tread His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) a career army Special Forces Division officer who was the darling of the US Military until he went AWOL and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between Vietnam Laos and Cambodia The official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity Sheens mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public none the wiserbr br The movie is rather episodic The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as Sheen and his crew meet different self-contained aspects of the war at the ground level American audiences of the 1970s had probably never seen this kind of film-making before with the possible exception of The Deer Hunter which was released in the previous year The first and one of the most notable is an helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner He loves to play Ride of the Valkyries from Wagners The Ring when he bombards helpless villages His line I love the smell of Napalm in the morning is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunniesbr br Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film Not even the likes of Clive Barker Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery Brandos Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from withinbr br Without giving too much away Coppolas solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations According to the documentary Hearts of Darkness Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama and the atmosphere of the movies darker hues would be compromised He wasnt sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at his village After the viewing Coppola had his ending and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making Love it or hate it no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scenebr br This film is not for all tastes just as Conrads original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes Its not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb Its the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle which is as it should be Coppola did not make a family picture However if the viewer can understand its larger point there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now! If youre looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism better stick with John Wayne But if youre willing to be taken into places youve never been even beyond the evils of war rhetoric Apocalypse Now will take you into a world you thought youd never visited before and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it
Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces it is hard for Capt Willard to understand how Col Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willards long journey through the jungle to find his target he tries with some success to understand why But what will he decide to do once he finds him?br br Any movie that can start out with The Doors The End is a great movie in my book especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song Apocalypse Now does this perfectly I cant think of anything better for it to be set to the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders minds that it created AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam the ultimate destination of which is murder Through its use of music and score alone we are thrown into a dark world of mystery violence and insanity A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here br br An overall great cast with the exception of Laurence Fishburne of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread I just dont like Fishburne ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWees playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care We need to sick Gary Oldman on him Brando is excellent as Col Kurtz and I cant think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvalls Lt Colonel Kilgore Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly its my favorite of his parts to date He simply nailed his character which is one of the best in the entire film as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant I also love the smell of napalm in the morningbr br The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesnt take too much brainpower to figure out whats going on Willards mission is to kill Kurtz plain and simple But its the journey of the film that is really its heart and also the dire situations of war itself In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the films entirety other than it makes it a longer journey I dont feel they take away anything though its just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original Through this journey the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in itin fact thats the entire point On top of that the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz to go completely mad br br A big war movie lover this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter all of them classics I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what Ive said All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam Warso to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointlesseven if after having most recently view AN I think its a tad better In the end Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status its been given As a fellow reviewer has previously stated AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made
Spoilers This review has been edited due to word limitbr br The horror The horror Marlon Brando Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)br br The sentence which is as famous as Heres looking at you kid or Are you talkin to me? or May the Force be with you or Ill be back means a little more than some one-liners When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single framebr br What exactly does this line of dialogue mean? The horror spoken of is the reality of war The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt When Capt Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Col Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film The horrorthe horror is the realization of Willards corruptness He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment This isnt a typical Hollywood ending In most cases a character gains something whether it be emotionally physically mentally or all three But Willard both gains and loses He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals And that is a shocking endingbr br Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppolas tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking This film is wholly different from The Godfather It is hallucinogenic visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature At first it seems realistic and then it becomes strange and then symbolic and by the end original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war within usbr br At first it does appear to be another war film Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz (Brando) who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slavesbr br Willard carries out his mission with extreme prejudice heading out on a boat along with four soldiers including the boat captain Chief (Albert Hall) Chef (Frederic Forest) and a very young Larry Fishburne (who later went on to appear as Morpheus in The Matrix)br br Apocalypse Now is in a many ways a modern update of Homers Odyssey As our main character Willard carries on his journey he meets an array of original and strange characters including Lt Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who has a strange fetish for surfing and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper) whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in The Million Dollar Hotel one of the worst films I have ever seen Davies failed to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages In this case he is translating Kurtz to Willard although Im not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willardbr br Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines Apocalypse Now has many Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagners Ride of the Valkyries remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history There is sharpness to it a brutality to it an ironic tone to it and also a sense of playfulness When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says I love the smell of napalm in the morningit smells like victory we all crack a smilebr br I wont lie to you: Apocalypse Now is a strange film It isnt exactly the easiest thing to analyze The end may frustrate some viewers if they dont understand Marlon Brandos significant speeches But what it all comes down to what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche The horror is the realization of war and its effects not the war itself Kurtz says You have a right to kill me But you have no right to judge me Brandos character Kurtz is left to the audience to judge To many naïve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head But that isnt what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across By fighting in Vietnam Kurtz has realized just how great he had it and how bad some others had it By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the naïve ones living our lives in a fools paradise We are totally naïve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something Just how easily he could end up like the people around him And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door Many people think the horror is one thing It is two For Kurtz the horror is the reality of how naïve he was and the reality of the wars impact upon men And after Willard murders Kurtz and hears Kurtzs dying words he realizes it too He realizes the effects of war To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man And what it has done to him The horrorbr br 55 stars -br br 
Well Ive watched this movie for over 25 years now and its still almost as interesting as when I first saw it It is definitely one of the most unique films ever madebr br I still think Martin Sheen got dissed big-time in the billing too He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours 17 minutes film (theatrical version) How unfair is that?br br Sheen is fantastic in here especially his narration which runs throughout Its one of the best narrations if not THE best I have ever heard in a movie His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible nightmare-like adventure I never fail to appreciate his work in this moviebr br The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes ones I have never forgotten such asbr br Sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movies first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagners dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brandos bizarre character It goes on and on with strange scenesbr br Thats not to say I enjoyed everything No there are a few very unpleasant scenes such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (cant watch that anymore) an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheens young stoned-out crew and the crew is a little too goofy at times Then there is the huge amount of profanity led by way too many f-wordsbr br So there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this One thing for sure: it is a film you WILL remember!
From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out It has this freakish feel to it Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies What does push to such a high level is the: br br The directing was spectacular here Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war Most others just display and show you the horrors of war Coppola though makes you feel confused shocked and scared These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film The writing was of course amazing too It brought you write into the middle of the movie It never made me bored and this movie is three hours The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calmbr br The acting was bone-chilling Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded out of whack colonel When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now With Brando n this film you dont want to look into his eyes Like the movie he was freakish To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming Also Duvalls character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both lovebr br I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting directing writing cinematography and great ending Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now
After the success of the first two Godfather films in 1972 and 1974 respectively Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975 The plot was loosely based on the book Heart of Darkness a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the nativesCoppola retains much of this including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtzs headquarters and his final words The horror the horror br br In the film Sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into Cambodia and eliminate with extreme prejudice a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities On his journey up the river to the renegades camp he experiences the demoralization of the US forces high on dope or drunk with power br br Although as a result of cuts forced on Coppola the film was accused of incoherence when first released it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of Vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound br br Apocalypse Now was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored As a result the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is
This movie changed the art of film making telling a complex story in a powerful new way The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke The film uses music not as a score laid in later but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers radios etc Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration taking scenes and characters and putting them into entirely different surroundings That is a tricky and brave thing to do Then he takes a superstar Brando pays him a fortune and films him so that you can barely see his face The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding and it works beautifully This movie belongs in the top ten
Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (Spielberg Copolla and others are named there) The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isnt a great director The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician most of his films lack depthSaving Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view but its message is dull and while its very entertaining it doesnt make you think about anything AN is the best movie I ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things starting from war in general the clash of civilizations the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither the french lady says he is both ) and many others The problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false But a great movie and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments not to solve them  Maybe Coppola is right or maybe he isnt nobody holds the truth anyway You can watch this movie for its outer beauty amazing scenes great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality You cant help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentaryBoth Copolla and Moore tackle similar issues but while Copolla presents matters from an outside  objective point of view Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary  It is really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 911 won a prestigious award like Cannes But anyway if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war the Iraq war the second World War and any war in general you should definitely see this movie and not the other one 
Francis Ford Coppolas Apocalypse Now is not a Vietnam War film Do not confuse it with one It is set to the back drop of the war but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche It is also one of the most audacious films ever made produced or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the films production levelsbr br Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors The End as Martin Sheens Captain Benjamin L Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes Willards mission is to terminate with extreme prejudice Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and as told by his general is out there operating without any decent restraint totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct And he is still in the field commanding troops Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god For Willard this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat yet the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behaviorbr br Teaming up with a small crew they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat Along the way Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz During Sheens raspy voice over he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret He was a normal man with a family until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz As he reads about this mythic figure he is drawn to the mans power and why he has become what he has become We know that Willards slow decay will parallel that of Kurtzsbr br Marlon Brando has been revered for decades His presence: unmatchable His genius: undeniable But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance Brando can be perceived in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer as a hack He is most certainly not Brando was difficult to work with hard to interpret and impossible to understand but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didnt His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profunditybr br If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppolas actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one mans fanatical struggle to produce a movie It is reported that during the films 200 plus day principle photography schedule Coppola contemplated suicide The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch Coppolas sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheens haunted soldier Willardbr br I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace Audacity aside Apocalypse Now is pure film-making My respect and admiration for Mr Coppola is of the highest order But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for todays standards for film: a lack of innovation It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart But we still have the great ones like Coppolas masterpiece a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehendbr br That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness The killing can disturb The loss of innocence can unhinge But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual the savage and the animalistic If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis
i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie ive never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels they just dont make movies like this anymorebr br after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness) im even more amazed that this film even got finished yet alone turn out so greatbr br the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Phillipines is the films greatest asset you actually FEEL like your in Vietnambr br all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being Robert Duvall (I love the smell of napalm in the morning!!) martin sheen and the great Marlon Brandobr br a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky weird and cerebral near the end well remeber what Coppolla said about this movie This film is not about vietnam it IS vietnam! what he means is that this film is about MADNESS and not the warbr br this movie is based on the short story Heart of darkness by Joseph Conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinionbr br this is perfect challenging film that is dark violent humorous at times and well done in every single possible waybr br a true classicbr br rating:10
Apocalypse Now Redux Francis Ford Coppolas war opus is probably the most beautiful war film I have ever seen Capt Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into Cambodia to terminate the position of Col Kurtz (Marlon Brando) a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers Escorting him up the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men and along the way they encounter several interesting people (most notably is Robert Duvalls Kilgore a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrifying situations br br Apocalypse is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study It is more Full Metal Jacket than Platoon The running time of Apocalypse is over three hours but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived I was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed The beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me however After seeing this film I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history The Godfather films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone and shadows created the feeling of a Baroque composition With Apocalypse there is an incredible usage of natural light and the shadows particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen almost become a living character they are so pervasive and effective Another gorgeous scene was when Cpt Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes and come across a tiger The sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian but the colorization of the scene was incredible While everything else was almost a muted grey the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green an effect that was particularly striking Another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attack the small village while playing Wagner This could have just been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene but instead Coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to scare the hell out of them br br The performances in Apocalypse are first class Much has been made of the amount of money Brando earned for the film and the amount of trouble he caused Regardless of this he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time Sheen is completely outstanding - this is the first time I have seen him really unleash in a film  and Duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony Kilgore Apocalypse Now is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now (most know several choice lines from the film I love the smell of napalm in the morning et al) but I knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience I have not seen the original cut of Apocalypse Now so I cannot compare it to this newer cut but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced 810br br --Shelly
During the final throes of the Vitnam war our central character Capt Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has allegedly gone completely insane but who is successfully waging a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia a neutral and therefore off-limits countrybr br The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as he is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we dont understand something and we are unable to control it exterminate it Kurtz had eventually come to know thisbr br Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtzs darkened lair you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie Kurtzs subtle deal with his executioner his unilateral surrender in return for Willard agreeing (did he nod?) to tell Kurtzs son (another metaphor for us the next generation the ones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam is mind-expanding stuffThe bonding between the two men whilst Kurtz cross-examines Willard--interlaced with some of his own horror stories is incredible nay genius film The closing (intercut)scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols Coppolla has made intentionally or not the ultimate anti-war statement one that should resonate through the ages
As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film I find it very interesting how few middle of the road comments there are Everyone either loves it or they hate it Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????) I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film Why would you like a film thats so confusing? ask many of my associates The answer is this: Forget the war forget the brutalityThis is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job he does it too well without adhering to the accepted standards of death and destruction (Am I the only one whos troubled by the fact that we have standards for death and destruction????) so they send the Conformity Police out to eliminate the individual HmmmmmmDraw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr Coppola whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time I think he transcended his original intent of the movie and probably didnt even realize it until after the movie was released The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead it seems to have grown itself like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production as did the cast and crew but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold So if you havent seen the movie rent it watch it then watch it again and maybe a few more times and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film Those of you that have seen it watch it again with the mindset previously described I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!
I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time  I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it br br This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie  I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound  editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted  and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border br br How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but hes everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director  I said  was  in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head  but his sacrifice was worth it  In John Milius original solo draft we have a script thats just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen  but Coppolas involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war  Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldnt have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes  so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension  When Coppola states  This movie isnt about Vietnam - It is Vietnam  hes right  What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the films setting ( The Manson trial suggests its 1970 ) had changed Americas view of both the world and itself and of the worlds view of America br br Its the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime  Ive not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didnt feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic  In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel whos leading an injun war party  or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier whos leading a resistance movement on Mars  though this is probably down to Joseph Conrads original source novelbr br My all time favourite movie and its very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb
My favourite movie of all time This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary Heart of Darkness made it even more compelling Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making the Godfather and GodfatherII and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like Apocalypse Now Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col Kurtzs compound And just like Willard he DIDNT know what he was going to do once he got there This is such a masterpiece of American cinema beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story What I like most about Apocalypse Now is that it offers no answers or conclusions Consequently because of this open-endedness it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious br br This movie defies categorization Some call it a war movie which it isnt at all really it is more of a personal study of man The best pic about Vietnam is Platoon in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers br br Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with GenCorman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classicbr br It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratificationbr br A little footnote definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now watch the original version first the Redux version is I think more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a new and improved version of the movie
Touching Bollywood epic melodrama about a 10 year-old girl who finds out that shes adopted and is determined to find her birth mother The films major success is the performance of PS Keerthana who plays the girl The first half of the film is very good There are a few really good songs too especially the number that introduces the protagonist Unfortunately the films second half which takes place in war-torn Sri Lanka feels like an entirely different and disappointing movie Its big on explosions and special effects with Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels dodging grenades running from fireballs and being yanked by stunt wires All the film can offer as insight are cheap platitudes like Some day there must come peace and Perhaps the children will find a way The final sequence where the daughter and mother are reunited is good but so over-the-top with the music and a well-timed downpour that it feels like a cheat I know I know its all in the style of Bollywood But this is a story where big moments simply detract from the simple powerful central story Bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times too
Recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film by Director Mani Ratnam at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival I have bestowed my highest honour of the Film Festival on this feature Make sure that you do not let an opportunity to experience this cinematic gem pass you by  but be forewarded: this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as homo sapien! A 10 !!
Last night I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles) Oddly it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDbbr br At first I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it At the beginning a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated Months later the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India At a refugee center you see the lady about to give birth--after which the titles to the film finally are revealedbr br The entire focus of the film then changes completely--to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras India You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family None of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing--what about the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film Somehow or another she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad #2--though she did NOT realize these people were not her biological parentsbr br Soon after this the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film) as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage AND tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother Seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents (particularly the adoptive mother) was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interestbr br Unfortunately Sri Lanka has been involved in a very very long and brutal civil war with Tamilese militants off and on for three decades The familys decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka was indeed noble but also a bit stupid at times--as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war! This was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents--first you tell her she ISNT your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE!!! Sure the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother but this really was stupid in hind sight If it were me I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid--thus avoiding being in the middle of a war!br br Despite my complaints the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding Far from perfect it sure hits an emotional home run Also while I expected this because I have seen several Indian films many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where--this IS standard in most films from India--including those made in Bollywood (Bombay) and TamilwoodKollywood (Madras)
It pays to watch Readers Digest Or Time if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece Based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents Mr Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practisesbr br Where does one start? The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer-author and 3 adorably naughty children? Or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredulous and sinister events and ideologies? Whichever way one looks at it this film is worth being in your collection if you happen to like Mani Ratnams compelling dramasbr br Mr Ratnam is a past master in blending fictional tales within real life incidents and in this film he oozes class in adapting two real-life stories into one I will not go into the story as it is better seen than read But what I will dwell upon is the impact it had upon me and why for all the war-mongering that happens in this world it cannot destroy that simple yet inexhaustible force called hopebr br Innocence in its purity cannot fathom the complex desires of adult decadence and greed Nor does it recognize perils when it is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants It is an innocence of such nature that drives Amudha to seek her biological parents despite warnings that they could be lost in the cauldron of civil war Having survived a terrorizing experience of conversing with a physically challenged man only to realize that he is a more lethal entity in disguise Amudha sticks to her cause in a manner that tears down her well-wishers resistance And finally when the twain do meet mother and daughter the reunion is so taut with emotion that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears Aided by a coruscating background score from A R Rahman the scene that follows is poignant to melt even the stoniest of hearts: a list of questions that Amudha has to ask her biological mother In a culmination as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to it a child discovers its mother alive in body but lost in spirit With the crushing realization that she has no hope of staying with the one who bore her Amudha does to her adoptive mother what this films title means: a peck on the cheekbr br As for the cast the trail is clearly blazed by the brilliant PS Keerthana Mr Ratnam has a gift of extracting spectacular performances from little-known child artistes but this should take nothing away from Keerthana for an award-winning performance With an able supporting cast of Madhavan (Thiru) Simran (Indira) and the stupendous Nandita Das (Shyama) she embellishes the scenes in almost every frame she is in The music may be not as memorable as other Rahman offerings but that still didnt stop him from garnering another National Award for the best music direction Vellai Pookal is as much an ode for the need to cherish human life as it is for nature The dialogues are top-class (sample the touching exchange Amudha and Indira have on the swing shortly after the revelation that she is not Indiras biological daughter) and the cinematography superbbr br This film is a clear statement to drop arms as much as it is to respect human life and expressions Do not judge it as a lesson in film-making; you will only lose out on experiencing one of the very best from the Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman stable
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal Such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion Mani Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots(In fact this was the only movie where he went outside India everthat too just to sri lanka)Manis class is written all over the movieand to add to it ARRs musicwhich is just amazingVellai Pookal is one of my most fav songs ever Maddywho is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too Starting from alaipayuthey to kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru Mani ratnam has showed to the world what a versatile actor Maddy is Simran has been really good too She has showed that she can act too in non-glamorous and character roles In all an amazing movie Sad that the tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 movie and it bombed at the box-office
This film is absolute gold If you havent seen it do Mani Ratnam outdoes himself once again This film introduced me to Nandita Das as well though everyone shines in this movie My only regret is Ive never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of Southern India as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart Beautiful subtle witty with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer this movie stands up to being seen again and again and the story within the story The Umbrella is done so well as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book Lovely Watch it
I have seen this movie when it was released and no doubt it is heart touching I liked the point of view of a kid who came to know that what she was thinking about her were actually not true Its a shatter to that small kid And her search to find out who she is And before and after she knows about her the relationship between her and her foster-mom Thats a nice view A R Rahman adds his stress by a good re-recording and songs In this movie mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advices (like in Vuyire) but simply narrates the characters as they are  And because of that the film exactly strikes the audience The pool bath scene of chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas did not convey perfectly what it meant for Mani Ratnam has amazingly improved
When you want to celebrate life and love especially for precious little daughters you have to shout it from the countryside And what gorgeous countrysides! There are so many tears of joy even God joins in See this moviebr br 
Kannathil Muthamittal is for sure a great movie I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great directing job and AR Rahman for great songs The camera work is just excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work
Hello all! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam wouldve given an excellent film! I was stunned!! The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse the cinematography editing and all other technical details Full marks to the cast and crew I have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there Excellent work! Though the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan such a work was never attempted on Indian Screen Overall the movie is great! And hats off to MrManiratnambr br Mani Ratnam has once again proved that he is a director who can take Indian cinema to great heights! I would love to watch this film again and again An excellent film and a must see
To tell you the truth I do not speak Tamil and I did not understand the film My good Tamil friend Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow what a long name) explained every thing to me What a great movie!!! After watching this movie I felt I should have watched many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry) The war scenes were amazing camera work excellent and plot beautiful The actress Simran what a beauty Give her an award for best looking someone Ding Ding Ding come on I smell a OSCAR winner I didnt understand the songs but they were excellent Mani Ratnam is a great director and I hope his next film was a success
You dont have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movieI dont know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to meUnderstanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but I could make out the story because the lead actors (and actresses)emoted really wellAnd the little girl was really cute (she wasnt irritating like child actors in most hindi movies)The story is really touching and hats off to Mr Ratnam for trying something differentThe relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically(I could identify with the characters in the movie)It was alltogether a movie that will remain in my heart forever and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to my friendsAlso the songs are just out of this world!They were beautifully and meaningfully picturisedIf only I could understand the right meaning of the lyrics:(
I think this is one of the best tamil movies ive seen in a while i love the fact that it doesnt revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly The cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother Best of all are the songs beautiful music and moving lyrics There are some great songs in this move yall! especially Kannathil Mutthamittal and Velai Pookal Great songs both of them I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting (and superb songs! ) Cheers Simran
When I stepped into the theater I thought this was going to be a great movie And I was not disappointed one bit WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran Beautiful music by AR Rahman This might most probably be the best Tamil movie Ive seen in ages Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt moviesbr br This movie is basically about a young girl (PS Keerthana) who is in search of her biological mother (Nandita Das) who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (JD Chakravathy) A young novelist (Madhavan) finds out about this young girls story and decides to write a story about her He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological motherbr br This movie really screams EXCELLENT The way Mani Ratnam presented the movie is magnificent br br My Rating - 1010
This is an incredible movie that begins slowly It leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama Then in the second half there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scopebr br If you are unaccustomed to films from India with song and dance routines seemingly grafted on for no reason stick with this movie Especially beginning with the second half you will find this movie an amazing experiencebr br  Minor Spoiler Here  I have but one complaint with the movie The dialog at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring in the war as a force that transforms peoples lives It was implied all along but there should have been something about the importance of the struggle for MDS
One more classic performance by Maniratnam and his team They can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an all time classic The war and its impacts in Sri Lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect Madhavan no wonder he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role he plays and it needs real daringness to act as a father for three kids when he is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry Music by AR Rahman makes the movie a special one for those who love melodies Above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times
Mani is back wit a Rathnam(gem) he manages to capture the mental trauma of a small girl searching 4 her mother they way he goes about showing the problems-in Ceylon is a treat  Tis movie is a must watchthe musical score does enhance the viewing pleasure Rahman a find of Rathnam has given some great tunes the lyrics r apt 4 the movie the locations used for the movie are very good and makes viewing pleasant the movie starts of in a light manner moves over to capture the feelings of the girl finally goes on o shed light into the life of people in war torn places across the world this is yet another classic from ManiRathnam
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yeras Eve watching an amazing drama unfold It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child Several years later we see Amudha a playful well-loved child (P S Keerthana) who is the darling (or burden) of teachers parents and fellow schoolmates alike in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not their biological child she was adopted This tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her Several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother The country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess But this also leads to their meeting the new Shyama - one who finally is confronted by Amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughterbr br The story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother the unconditional love of the adoptive parents the demons that drive the birth mother the normalcy of Chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring AR Rahmans music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film The film has excellent performances from Madhavan Nandita Das Simran and an absolute stunner role as Amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste P S Keerthana This performance won her a National awardbr br The cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot I am intrigued by the connection Mani Ratnam has with terrorism love and obsessions I think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding Mahadevans character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl His one liners were hilarious The mother played by Simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids The shock angst and obsession of the child Amudha was outstandingly portrayed by P S Keerthana Her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking In fact the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das and her husband Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes It also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedybr br Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - I rarely weep in the movies but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick This is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film!
The Director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian film I had seen Dil Se which led me down the path of buying well over 122 Hindi DVDs in thebr br course of four months I can say I understood the total attraction I wasbr br somehow confused as to why the film would stop for music videos It was an excellent movie I didnt know what to make of the dancing and the femalebr br vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears but somehow I found AR Rahmens score hypnotic I bought the soundtrack the following day and then Lagan Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and with the exception of Ichi thebr br killer a few other Korean films  I cant be bothered to watch much else Kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of Hong Kong Horrorbr br and ActionScience fiction films for the past 30 yearsbr br But I should get back to Kannathil Muthamittal It is one of the Mani Ratmans latest efforts and I laughed Cried Got totally mad terrified and most of all I didnt feel manipulated The acting was superb the photography was beautiful I think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting The music fit the movie perfectly and after thebr br credits rolled I wanted to watch again so I didbr br It would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop This is what great film is all about! I stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over!br br My wife is watching now and I cant wait for her reaction I cant expect it will be anything less than mine
This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary and the acting spectacular At first I thought this wasnt going to be that great because of a summary but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that I was dead wrong I literally cried about four or five times in this movie and despite this I mustve watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No the song scenes were not as awesome as they couldve been but the plot is what really gets you American or Asain I would recommend this to anyone--and I have now I guarantee that after seeing this one youll get the best out of it and its plot I hope you feel the same and write a rave review too!
Kannathil Muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies ive seen in a long time the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her parentage she sets out in an endeavour to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terroristbr br the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity mani ratnam generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best moviesbr br the movie is emotionally draining and tugs at the heart of the viewer keerthana as the 9 year old amudha and simran as her adopted mother are simply brilliant their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie there are some notable flaws here particularly the scene where amudha learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did another flaw is surprisingly enough the brilliant songs they again seem forced and stand out not gelling with the rest of the scriptbr br having said these this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in teh technical brilliance as well ravi chandrans camera work is sheer poetry all characters perform creditably and the realistic humour especially in teh flashback scenes are entertainingbr br a sincere 9!!
In Sri Lanka a country divided by religion and language the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) a separatist organization has claimed an estimated 68000 lives since 1983 Human rights groups have said that as a result of the war more than one million people have been displaced homeless or living in camps The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek winner of several awards at the National Film Awards in India While the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girls voyage of discovery the human cost of war is made quite clear and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoingbr br Beautifully photographed in Southern India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of Sri Lanka the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in Sri Lanka Played with deep feeling and expressiveness by PS Keerthana in a memorable performance Amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out leaving her in a Red Cross camp In a loving flashback we see Amudhas adoptive parents father Thiru (Madhavan) a prominent Tamil writer and mother Indra (Simran) a TV personality marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girlbr br Young Amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday according to the parents prior agreement While she is playing Thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that you are not our daughter and the response is predictable Distraught she questions who her father was what her mothers name was why she gave her up and so forth but few answers are forthcoming Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother now a fighter for the Tamil separatists The familys immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions handled mostly with skill by Ratnam though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurishbr br A Peck on the Cheek is of course a Bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama The melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however I found the musical dramatizations of songs by A R Rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing Yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the films limitations Tamil cinema has been criticized by many even within the country as being too clichéd and commercial yet A Peck on the Cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues That it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute
I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamilbr br Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up withBy the way to all we westerners Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotionbr br Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like Devdas to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges toppled Lagaan last yearbr br Devdas is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of Love fate and destiny I would keep away from it Anyway not sending a movie like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a revamp Indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence Now I know why this country has so many issues They are heavily talented but not showcased properly
Sri Lanka not a country Ive ever given much thought to I have to admit I didnt even know it was near India let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983 It seems that the rebels of the Tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the islandbr br Mani Ratmans latest film A PECK ON THE CHEEK tells the story of a young girl named Amudha who is separated from her Sri Lankan parents by the war and raised by a young Indian couple Amudha is a bright and mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child Although her adopted parents love her as much as could be and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children Amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological familybr br Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story (or is it the other way around?) A PECK ON THE CHEEK inhabits similar territory but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers The central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family and especially that between a child and her adopted parents Its a pretty honest and open look at feelings that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others Its an emotionally complex film with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human waybr br The film revolves around 9 year old Amudha played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress PS Keerthana in her first and only acting role Shes a princess and a monster always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long The young actress is perfectly cast for the role and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of herbr br A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name I was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience Never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact I dare say The film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screenbr br Mani Ratmans direction is superb very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work Ive seen from this director yet The film is visually very stylish with some excellent camerawork and imagery AR Rahman provides the films soundtrack which is not as good as his classic DIL SE or BOMBAY music (based on first impressions at least) but still shows his great musical talentbr br Im not aware of a DVD release for the film yet - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight The production is a truly world class effort and I am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposurebr br Recommended
I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festivalbr br This is the first Indian film Ive seen in the Tamil language and while it does share some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography sweeping storyline) the director attempts more than just to entertain The film tells the story of Amudha a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka Gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point though it is a simplistic one Amudha is played by PS Keerthana and she is one of the few child actors Ive seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying Her charm and beauty held the film together
Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people only to have a heart attack himself! He ends up dying on an operating table and for the sake of revenge his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson) who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demonbr br While I know enough about the directors filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock Nurse Sherri is really not all that bad Sure its clear that this was very low-budget stuff yet all that I found egregiously cheesy about it were the visual effects The acting is not as bad as one might expect eitherbr br There are two different versions available of this on DVD A much more sex-oriented version featuring bountiful amounts of T & A is the original cut with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their strangest sex moments including one involving fellatio during a college lecture!br br The movie would then be re-cut for theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly Some scenes are dropped with new ones added (with Stevens the role played by JC Wells expanded) The movies most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a foundry and it works quite well This cut of the movie is more interesting overall; I would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare thembr br Both versions hit their stride in the final third and benefit from a marvelously scene-stealing performance from Bill Roy as the crazed Reanhauer and a moody climax set in a graveyard (although actually filmed in Adamsons backyard!) Marilyn Joi is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden) whos lost his eyes in a car accident and who incidentally is key to resolving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals The movie also makes amusing use of music from composer Harry Lubins personal collection including compositions for such TV series as One Step Beyond and The Outer Limitsbr br Nurse Sherri (known by more alternate titles (including Beyond the Living and Hospital of Terror) than any other Adamson movie) is actually fairly entertaining low-budget fare I ended up having a good time watching itbr br 710
Meet Sherrifor an evening of Pleasure and Terror! Cheap special effectscheesy linesyep its the original 1978 Movie Nurse Sherri Starting Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmondand Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and Directed by Al Adamsonbr br The movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospitalthen she starts killing doctors one by oneThe acting was okay but some of the acting was roboticThe storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more viewsThe directing was badAnd the special effects looked like a drawingthe effects didnt fool anybodythe death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didnt make any sense like the sex scenesthe nuditythe football playerand many morebr br Overall Its A Good MovieBut Not The Bestbr br 7 Out Of 10
I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career but The Possession of Nurse Sherri stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-Z schlockfests like Horror of the Blood Monsters and Dracula Vs Frankenstein This film is actually scary! Am I saying that youre going to jump out of your seat when you watch Nurse Sherri? No of course not But this pastiche of elements from The Exorcist Ruby and Carrie is one of those nice eerie little horror movies common to the seventies You cant put your finger on whats so spooky about it but the film drips with atmosphere (And what an ending! Dont worry I wont spoil it for you) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed it with this one and it doesnt matter whether Nurse Sherri was a calculated success or a happy accident Jill Jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy who shines in his brief role) Geoffrey Land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing Nurse Sherri was a Poverty Row production and it shows at times (sets special effects etc) Still the film has heart mostly decent acting and direction and some genuine chills Sam Sherman also saw fit to use Harry Lubins theme music for the late 50searly 60s television series One Step Beyond in this film which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere The DVD contains two significantly different cuts of the movie (the early version features a lot of T&A that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff) as well as the theatrical trailer the TV spot and a great commentary by Sherman Does anybody know whatever happened to Bill Roy by the way? Next to John Carradine hes the best actor Ive ever seen in an Al Adamson film and he plays the cult leader like he means it
What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? Youd think so by some of the reviews Al Adamsons films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy not much more so if you go into them knowing that already it helps and they arent necessarily to be taken at face value especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value First off this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits so you know things are looking promising This is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital Of course Nurse Sherri tends to his needs and all and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her And Nurse Sherri begins to change No longer the nice nurse she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects Theres a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of Sherris co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo This is not bad if youre a cult film fan but it may be bad if youre a Spiderman fan because you wont like it At times this actually lurches towards respectability (for Adamson anyway) but then it unredeems: itself with some ridiculous event If you enjoy Adamsons films and similar trash you may well like this for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure keep digging 7 out of 10
This is one of those games where you love it to bits or hate it to shredsEven being a hardcore Mario fan can make you dislike this gameYou can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and easyOr you can love it because it is a mixture of amazing graphics(not a Nintendo fan huge excitement) music or game playI know a lot of people that say it is amazingand others who think its the worst Mario everIt really depends on the type of Nintendo fan you areI personally love this game and I think it is the best wii gamebut you should determine that for yourselfSo I think you should absolutely get it if you are the right Nintendo fanBut If you love The classics too muchyou may not like itSo try it out yourself
Ever since 1981 Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because theyre always adding something new It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that theres a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011 The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons br br And I have more good news Super Mario Galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010
(Warning: May Contain Spoilers) Let Rosalina help Mario lead the way and smile because this game will brighten your day br br 120 stars will require luck and skill but 60 will bring you as much of a thrill!br br Blasting through stars show Mario and Luigi and what travelers they now are! br br Walking upside down has never been more fun especially a final battle with Koopa near the Sun! br br This is truly a super awesome game and it absolutely deserves a place in Nintendos Hall of Fame!

The levels are fun and exiting They will hook you till your mind turns to mush Im not kidding This game is also orchestrated and is beautifully done br br To keep this spoiler free I have to keep my mouth shut about details But please try this game!

the mario series is back and in my opinion better than ever Galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64 the controls are great; some of the best for the wii beautiful graphical design as well the levels are very big and the good old bosses are back there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64 and 2: the difficulty isnt very high; though it does require some patience mario fans: the game youve been waiting for Casual gamers: this game is more than worth the buy 98 out of 10
THIS COMMENT WILL PROBABLY HAVE SPOILERS!! I CHECKED THE SPOILERS BOX JUST IN CASE BUT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE SPOILERS BUT BE AWARE ANYWAYS IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER A SPOILER AND I DONT! Wowbest game since Super Mario 64 I got this game the first day it came out and before I got it I went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings (yes they already reviewed it before it came out) and I was shocked I was expecting something like Sunshine because lately all the Mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse But this one totally beat the other games The scores on this game even beat Halo 3! Its simply amazingbr br STORY: Not the best Mario games are never known for their plots and this one isnt really much of a difference Bowser once again kidnaps Peach but this time invades the Mushroom Kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer spacebr br GRAPHICS: Absolutely gorgeous the best graphics on Wii so far The water effects are really nice too if you ever see the water it looks so real because the effects they put in itbr br MUSIC: Simply amazing the music in this game is orchestrated Not all of it but even the ones that arent orchestrated still sound very nicebr br GAMEPLAY: Very entertaining keeps you wanting to play more and more and for me since usually I tend to be very frustrated with games if I die a lot I mean Im definitely not the only one but this game for me didnt have that a lot Now it still kind of did but not to the point like Mario 64 where I totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad this one never did thatbr br DIFFICULTY: There are two types of difficulty because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars which I think is kind of easy but to beat the game 100% you have to get 120 like always and that quest is way harder but at the same time still very funbr br LENGTH: Good length definitely not too short It took me around 15-16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars but 120 took me more like 45-50 hours Now I didnt play it constantly that much I played first a lot one day then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day then the next two days I played it all day To me though I think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short so if you want a long game I suggest getting all of thembr br PRESENTATION: Now the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb The way they are it just looks so much like something I would see in the theaters They are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any Mario game so farbr br OVERALL: This game is definitely a great game and I advise you to not wait until Christmas get it as soon as possible This game also is a good mixture of old and new youll have some sidescroller levels where you move just side to side or up and down because theyll change on gravity but even the music has some old classics in it So this game seems to be like a masterpiece To me its my favorite Mario game of all time but others may disagree But its still a great game I recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this
I have been a Mario fan for as long as I can remember I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in spacebr br The story begins much like any other Mario game Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom Upon arriving at Peachs castle Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr) attacking the castle with their airships Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Lumas home a floating space station here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader a woman named Rosalina Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space stations Power Stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach thus the adventure beginsbr br The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic Mario environments The best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment Then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the Wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 gamesbr br My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives Still these minor problems aside its a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging This is the type of game that weve been waiting for on the Wiibr br A perfect 10 out of 10!
I saw what I believe to be the best Australian film of the year so far Jon Hewitts Acolytesbr br Acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise Get thistwo bullied and molested teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb AND then set about blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them Hewitt has picked a top notch cast including excellent new comers Sebastian Gregory Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teens Add to that three yes thats right three great psychos! Lead by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour Belinda McClory his deranged spouse and Michael Dorman as the teen raping bully with swastika tattoos Once you add these teens and these menacing adults all hell breaks loose Hewitt has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynchs Twin Peaks but Hewitt makes it all his own in a Qld suburban back water always ringing with the drones of emptiness The script by Shayne Armstong Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tightbr br If marketed correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens The next Wolf Creek? It could well be It makes all the right moves The teens are real ala Larry Clark They dont suck and have an attached PC agenda they are non communicative good looking and hip The killers are dark with real menace Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the mild mannered local Ted Bundy who sports a butterfly on his 4WD spare ala John Fowles The Collector Dormans petrol head rapist pours on the menace that tops Suburban Mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you cant wait to see buy the farmbr br The film is fast paced tough and brutal Not only that it displays a confidence and directorial mastery from Hewitt that is surely to win him an IF or AFI nomination if not award! Its nuanced and poetic mise en scene brilliant sound design excellent cinematography and tight structure mark it as clearly one of the best directed Oz features I have seen so far this yearbr br The film leaves you shaken thinking and unsettled Its a truly great edition to the return to genre going on in Australian cinema at present It will surely garner the interest of Hollywood Oh and did I mention it got into Toronto? What other Oz feature films can say that much? The world should get ready for a new auteur Jon Hewitt
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment I watched this not expecting too much from it The Fact is that the cast were superb Especially The lead Teen Female The dark sides of them all came through all were messed up in an not obvious way There was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality The serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children What this movie is is a strong dramathriller Yes I would agree they dont do the obvious but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable Also a decent dark ending instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one The attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also I very good solid 7 out of 10 A little slow at times but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from
One of Chaplins longest films up to that point Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then Prosper Merimees well-known story about Carmen I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDbs listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer and from what Ive read those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes br br From the very beginning its clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplins most complex and ambitious efforts to date starting off with a long back story told through inter-titles about the tragic love story of Carmen br br Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies (A band who put the GYP in gypsy) to seduce a Spanish officer so they can pull off their smuggling operation Its a clever Chaplinesque band of criminals the leader of whom Lillas Pastia has spent 50 years learning to steal thinking he might be offered a job in politics br br On a side note Ive seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplins earlier work but probably none quite as overt as in this one Near the beginning of the movie as the band of gypsies are traveling there is a scene where the mules and women are loading and an inter-title explains that the mules are the ones with long ears In case you couldnt tell I guess br br Chaplin plays the part of Don Jose the hapless officer who is to be seduced by Carmen He is described as a brave soldier and lover of women Not exactly a stretch for Chaplin who removed any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms And of course he didnt have to act about being a lover of womenbr br What is different here of course is his polished military uniform and straight-backed disciplinary manner interspersed of course with some of his traditional slap-stick moves He strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff stolid exteriorbr br Soon Carmen enters (Loved by all men under the age of 96) and she immediately begins flirting with Charlie I should mention that for a good majority of the movie it is surprisingly faithful to the original story which was full of jealousy and tragedy Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover able to evoke a jealous passion that Ive never seen from him Theres at least one scene where he is genuinely a little scary br br Chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end And his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasnt very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on probably about five times longer than it was worth Although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop I always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie setsbr br The end of the film is its strongest part It bears striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet but just when you think that Chaplin is going to conduct a major thematic experiment by diverging distantly from his traditional style there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage Chaplin as anything Ive ever seen Nice work!
Being the second last of Chaplins Essanay films CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B Demilles drama with the same title It stands as quite obvious that Demilles acknowledged film didnt impress the comedy king that much which he later admitted in his autobiographybr br Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin He had done several of them already namely HIS PREHISTORIC PAST and HIS NEW JOB and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in films (for instance in A KING IN NEW YORK)br br Chaplin does a very good portrayal of Don José and Edna Purviances is very as good as Carmen Neither act as we are used to; Charlie is not the lovable Tramp and Edna is far from an innocent little woman but that was not Chaplins intentions either A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat odd Chaplin-film very different but includes good material nonethelessbr br The main story is although very differently structured as in the original drama Don José is very much in love with Carmen but is not alone in that field; Carmen Carmen (the) beautiful Carmen (is) loved by all men under 96 but he has the big advantage that he is an officer and there we are; this is the famous story about rivalry love greed and honor seen from a humorous perspective Thanks to Chaplins and Purviances performances and to the wonderful wonderful music by George Bizet which I highly admire this could actually have been a near-comedy masterpiece its time taken into consideration It could have been But unfortunately although it is a good pretty good comedy I dont feel its fair to blame people who claim that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece But its important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent but rather a result of conflicts concerning business When Chaplin refused to re-sign Essanay contract after completing his last film for the company POLICE they took revenge by editing back all the scenes Chaplin originally had edited out from CARMEN Thanks to this the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny and the film turned out to be rather a Ben Turpin-feature --Turpin played Remendados-- than a Chaplin-short Naturally Chaplin was in despair when he discovered what Essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several daysbr br Despite its obvious flaws A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended to Chaplin-fans and to admirers of beautiful music
I just re-watched this thriller one I had previously believed to be one of Hitchs lesser efforts How wrong can you be! Maybe because Im older or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing but now I think its amazing Every bit of suspense is wrung out of the tiniest detail and that final scene on the merry-go-round is just breath-taking! Perfect in every way highly recommended
The first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history(almost as good as the shower scene in Psycho) and the acting by Robert Walker is fantasticA psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murdersThat´s the story and overall this film is very good but theres one problem:why dosen´t Guy Haines go tobr br the cop in the first place45

This movie was fabulous It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film The directing and camera shots are nearly flawless(aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand clearly in slow motion) The plot is well written and realistic It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like thatbr br  I would rate Bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character( of course bates is first) Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac He didnt overact the part which made it believable(much the same how perkins didnt overact his part) Overall this is an excellent movie an absolute must see for any hitchcock fansbr br  br br 
This is another one of Hitchcocks highest rated movies and rightfully so This is a tale of two men who meet on a train and playfully exchange murder fantasies One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to trouble with the law Another fast moving Hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match are worthy of mentioning) Not a movie to be missed- it is a shame that no one will re-release this on DVD with loads of extras- just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD is all thats out there now
Its been said before--Strangers on a Train is Hitchcocks best movie--and hes made so many good ones! Like other Hitchcock Strangers on a Train requires your full attention to really appreciate it but once you canyou will
This is a well-crafted piece from everyones favorite master of suspense As usual the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the films time) I did not find the first part of the film very exciting but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after anotherbr br The only thing I did not like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for the part of Guy Haines Somehow I didnt find him very believable On the other hand Robert Walker shines as sinister bad guy Bruno Anthonybr br Overall I would highly recommend this
Rating: 8 out of 10 Directed by Alfred Hitchcockbr br Tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets the mysterious Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train Soon afterwards Guy finds himself drawn into the psychotic realm of Brunos world br br Guy is separated from his wife and is now involved with a senators daughter Guy is interested in entering into politics after he retires from tennis Bruno wants to kill his own father but doesnt want to do it himselfbr br Bruno proposes that he disposes with Guys wife while Guys part of the deal is to eliminate Brunos father Guy dismisses this idea since he isnt interested in having his troublesome wife killed br br Bruno goes ahead with his half of the proposal While Guy becomes the prime suspect of his wifes murder As law enforcement continues to investigate Guy Bruno continues to torment Guy wanting him to complete the other half of the proposal br br Strangers on a Train has one of the most exciting endings of all Hitchcock movies
Has aged really well - still thrilling and suspenseful today Certainly one of Hitchs best movies Beautifully shot with a great premise for suspense sex-appeal provided by beautiful Ruth Roman Because of the great premise you feel like you have to watch it to the end If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title as the Master of Suspense i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote 5 out of 5
I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM so I had the opportunity to see it Its rather hard to find despite it being a Hitchcock classic Unfortunately it also has its shortcomings some of which Hitchcock has repeated later First off the ending is a little too neat and perfect In the last few scenes until the last five minutes there is an astounding amount of tension; then the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up very unsatisfying The ending is also overly dramatic for a Hitchcock film He is was and always will be the master of suspense why would he stoop to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the ending? Apart from the few shortcomings the film is great The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal ever The theme? Simple You meet a stranger A perfect stranger He offers to kill someone for you you know you have someone you want(if nothing else subconsciously) dead The catch? He asks you to do the same for him will you accept this bizarre yet ingenious arrangement? Youre clear of suspicion and so is he after all neither of you knew the victim And you dont know each other either youre just strangers on a train Brilliant concept and one that just about every single person can relate to The pacing is good you never lose interest or patience The cinematography is good but not nearly as good as it is in other better Hitchcock films The acting is flawless The characters are well-written credible and realistic Hitchcock uses some of the same elements that he often uses; the dominating mother the mothers boy etc The film is very good but it just feels a little watered down It didnt go that famous extra mile that would have made it great It stopped before crossing the line between whats common and whats daring That is the primary reason for the film failing to be great but mainly remains good with potential to be more than that The end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed However everything leading up to the end is very good so the film still gets a deserving 810 Good but not great Any fan of Hitchcock should see it as it is among his best somewhat far down on the list but still there I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock 810
In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime i stumbled upon this film on cable I tried Hitchcock three times before this and never have i felt that the mans work lived up to the praise he had received I always felt he was good not great (from what Ive seen) This was the best of his films Ive seen thusfar Robert Walker is absolutely chilling his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go Even an average performance here damages the overall product My favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain (how exactly does he get his arm down there though?) Bruno is quite a compelling character but i also loved the performance by Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara The rest of the Morton family as well as Guy were a bit dry and boring but she added some flare to the movie as well as having some of the better lines in the scriptbr br Lastly in any suspense movie youre going to live and die by your ending This one holds water unlike a couple other Hitchcock films Ive seen I truly was unsure of how it would end which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited
I knew the premise of this film and obviously I cant miss a good sounding film especially from Master of Suspense director Sir Alfred Hitchcock Basically tennis champ Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets eccentric stranger Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train travelling from Washington to New York Bruno talks about a perfect murder Guy hates his wife and Bruno hates his father so Bruno suggests swapping murders Guy obviously didnt take him seriously until of course when Guys wife Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) is found murdered in an amusement park Guy of course is the chief suspect and Bruno keeps bumping into him reminding him of their plan and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead This murder enquiry and Brunos stalking are threatening his tennis career and his relationship with the daughter of Sen Morton (North by Northwests Leo G Carroll) Anne (Ruth Roman) Bruno realises that Guy wont do his murder so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty Guys monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park After his tennis game Guy and Anne (who obviously found out the murder plan) race to the amusement park to stop Bruno and they have a fight on the speeding out-of-control carousel Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (the directors daughter) as Barbara Morton Marion Lorne as Mrs Anthony Jonathan Hale as Mr Anthony Howard St John as Police Capt Turley and John Brown as Prof Collins and Hitchcocks cameo is the Man boarding train carrying a double bass Some interesting dialogue and character interactions some good suspense moments and of course the unforgettable carousel finale a good classic film It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons the film was number 32 on 100 Years 100 Thrills Very good!
As I looked at this movie once again I think it belongs among Hitchcocks greatest films The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense action and imagery It has the gripping ending the deranged murderer the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances some great on-location shots eg the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York It also has great supporting actors with Hitchs daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies The merry-go-round episode near the end is one of the most nerve-wracking in Hitchcocks body of workbr br Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full film) gives a great performance as the deranged stranger on the train who worms himself into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) Granger plays the nice guy who is caught up in a messy divorce The movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their taxis to board the train Eventually they meet and the story takes over The stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the movie continuesthe stranger becomes a stalker The action shifts from place to place including Washington the fictional small town of Metcalf the Forest Hills tennis championship and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions Towards the end the pace of a tennis game is woven into the plot as they race against time The camera cuts away to the faces of the athletes as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shots When the closely-fought contest is over the climactic chase takes place Hitchcock has a love for trains and it is great to see Penn Station long since gone Trains are featured in the 39 Steps the Lady Vanishes Shadow of a Doubt Spellbound North by Northwest and this movie br br This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense - the 1950s and I am convinced that one day it will be given its due in the Hitchcock hall of fame
One of Alfred Hitchcocks three greatest films along with Psycho and The 39 Steps Strangers On A Train is as brilliantly out-of-control as a merry-go-round in Metcalf and almost as deadly Its the kind of film you have so much fun watching you cant even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breathbr br Top amateur tennis contender Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a singularly weird louche stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train Thanks to the gossip pages Bruno knows all about Guys problems with his no-good wife Miriam and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Brunos father who wants to put Bruno in an institution Guy laughs it off but Bruno aint kidding as Guy finds out to his perilbr br Its a great premise for a murder story and Hitchcock gives Strangers On A Train a run for all its worth with the help of Walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any Hitchcock film including Anthony Perkins in Psycho While Perkins makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain Walker as Anthony is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement parkbr br What drives Bruno? Many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty Guy Yes Bruno lights up the old gay-dar but Guy seems happy enough on loves rebound with socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman) Brunos interest for Guy could just as easily be envy for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home letting Mommy file his nailsbr br Oh I certainly admire people who do things Bruno purrs looking like a cat eyeing a mouse You know it must be pretty exciting to be so importantbr br Later on Bruno calls himself a bum accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him even as he wrecks Guys life with his homicidal meddling Its the ultimate perverse underdogs tale Theres a sense of integrity about Bruno in his dogged dedication which commands our respect and which Hitchcock plays to so brilliantly When Bruno floats away from the scene of his big crime am I the only sick person in this world whos actually happy for him? I think not yet Hitchcock keeps the story on a right-enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen We dont want Bruno to win exactly but we enjoy his élan as he triesbr br Everything else is so perfect or at least close enough to make every shot memorable Hitchcock always managed at least 2-3 good setpiece sequences per movie; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone (20 Big Shows the neon side at the entrance says and they arent kidding) Script camera-work a gripping tennis match Ruth Romans jaw-dropping figure its all too much greatness for one film to contain Even Granger does his callow-youth thing here with more risible plausibility than Gregory Peck ever managedbr br You can call this a clinic in movie-making but clinic sounds too dull Strangers On A Train is good nasty fun all the way through leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along Heck Ill take that ride over again in a second!
Safer indeed Hitchcock is cinemas all time pervert; however we all know his perversions are ours as well so we forgive him And we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ridebr br I saw Hitchs 1953 I Confess a week before this one and I put both in the same category as part of his trademarks These trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsing his artistic veins that spills psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving stains of guilt instead very subtle awareness of feeling ashamebr br The pen is always mightier than the sword and Hitch firmly wrote the most arguable questions with his wrist and then holding firmly with his hands he held cameras that always reflected peoples thirst for blood (most humans have) otherwise comedy wouldnt be mostly a tragic thing and making people laugh wouldnt be so complexbr br Mixing all dark elements of high society with a wealthy psychopath Bruno and an ambitious tennis player wanna be politician Guy the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by Hitch inspiring many filmmakers not only with its plot but with tricky images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmaresbr br Barely perfect!
When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with David O Selznick ended because of this Actually he made some really good films in the period such as NOTORIOUS SPELLBOUND UNDER CAPRICORN ROPE and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked the audiences were turned off by Hitchs attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film) and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of its star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasnt) THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in its favorbr br With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith the story was of how Guy Haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete Bruno is talkative and fawning and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has metif a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space But Bruno knows all about Guys personal problems He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and is in love with Anne Morton daughter of a Senator Bruno knows that Miriam wont divorce her successful celebrity husband Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him Then Bruno mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea The train reaches Guys destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea He just does not realize that the eccentric Bruno is a sociopath and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each others foe!br br Its a wonderfully simple plot actually Bruno of course does kill Miriam but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather Guy is horrified - and worse he finds that he is the police departments number one suspect When Bruno to encourage Guy mentions he has the latters lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site Guy finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno?br br Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each others orbits It is like fate drawing them together Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch with a typical twist makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life One suspects that once Guy too had one but his marriages failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he wasbr br The cast is good too Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death) It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart) As for the ladies Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman) who bears a close resemblance to Miriam and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion She plays this rare role well Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed Other supporting performers Leo G Caroll as the Senator Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Brunos dotty mother and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master
I have never seen this in the theater my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to old VHS tape from rental storebr br Saucey for its time and Im sure the Hayes code was pushed to its limitsbr br Hitchs pallet here is the game play between two combatants And yes if Guy calls the cops on Bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter HELLO people do you always make the best or most logical choice How many times have you been in either persons shoes and made the right choice? For the love of God its called poetic licenseHowever as Guy sees the situation he has found himself in he takes it upon himself to rectify it He does not solicit help nor does he lie to his would be new wife Her defense of him sets off the final show down with Bruno feeling he has one more card to playbr br For the cop shot-ting an innocent person in pre-cam corder days and before rules of engagement this type of thing did happen In the post Rodney King world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man If you havent seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior your blind or have an application pending for the academenybr br Back to the moviebr br Go watch it with Try and wear a post WWII filter and pretend your seeing a great suspense movie like many did for the first time back then and sure its been copied since but your looking at one of the source of inspiration for many that followed
In Alfred Hitchcocks adaptation of Patricia Highsmiths Strangers On A Train Guy Haines (Farley Granger)and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker)meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders The rather pushy Anthony suggests that he could murder Haines unfaithful wife and Haines could murder Anthonys domineering father The lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved The tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going Haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious Complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines wife in an amusement park and then pursues Haines to keep his side of the bargainbr br The differences between the two men are clear from the start Haines is a professional tennis player respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas Anthonys life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling Haines is in a relationship with a Senators daughter who he wants to marry Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on Haines part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career The character differences are also reinforced visually Anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called Pluto whereas Haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera anglesbr br There are some striking visual sequences such as:- br br (1) The murder of Haines wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from Anthonybr br (2) The depiction of Anthony alone dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white Jefferson Memorial buildingbr br (3) The occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison following the action whilst one head (Anthonys) chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at Hainesbr br (4)The scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularlybr br Frequent use is made of doubles throughout the story for example Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train As the train pulls out of the station there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskies The Hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass Haines feels double crossed when his wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce Haines wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends When Anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses Anthony later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the Senators younger daughter who he sees as a double for Haines wife Anthony also feels double crossed when Haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder When Haines is travelling alone in a train going to Metcalf he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and Anthony hadbr br The action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the Senators younger daughter) are particularly powerful
In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock its apparent that Big Als fear from the police dates back to his childhood His father sent him to the police station carrying a note The note said: Hes been naughty imprison him for an hour The policemen obliged and ever since Hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the policebr br Strangers on a Train is probably one of the best in his wrongly-accused series The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel Thats the same author who wrote the Ripley series She was always fascinated by smart criminalsbr br Hitchcocks opening is very strong and takes you immediately to the protagonists: Guy Haines a famous tennis player and Bruno Anthony the aspiring criminal The two guys share a chemistry which in that day and age was probably a lot more than what the audience could chew Bruno tries to persuade Guy that they could commit the perfect murder (leaving no clues) if they switch victims Bruno will kill Guys wife who wouldnt give him a divorce and Guy would kill Brunos father The motives are respectively love and moneybr br Brunos performance is meant to be seductive and homoerotic This is not something that was done by accident In fact Hitchcock edited two versions of the movie: one US one UK In the US version the volume of Brunos seductiveness was turned down quite a bitbr br Strangers on a Train is a very deep movie but more importantly this is another excellent Hitchcock thriller An excellent example of a thrilling scene is when Guy is climbing the steps up to Brunos father room Hitchcock reasoned that the audiences attention needed to be distracted at this point so that they dont figure out what Guy will find in the room Hitch treats us to a HUGE menacing dog at the top of the stairs which provided the needed distractionbr br The most famous shot in the movie occurs during a tennis match Bruno has been continuously stalking Guy so that Guy will fulfil his end of the bargain (kill his father) When Guy looks at the audience all the heads are swiveling back and forth All except one - Brunos Hes looking straight at Guy with an ill-get-you smilebr br The ending is another example of suspense Both men fight for one key piece of evidence on a merry-go-round thats rotating at mad speed A worker is crawling under it so he could get to the controls When we finally get off this ride and the movie ends with Guy proving his innocence we are left exhausted and nail-less (for those of us still biting our nails!)br br Strangers on a Train is easily one of Hitchcocks best wrongly accused movies Some credit him with one of the best villains (Bruno) as well All in all the movie might appear somewhat dated but thats a lesson in thriller-making from the master himself I wont turn down Leonardo if he came to teach me Renaissance painting so neither should youbr br  Review posted at FilmDailiescom
This is one of Alfred Hitchcocks best films and one of his most underrated I believe it certainly exceeds a Psycho or The Birds for technical artistry and brilliance It is a macabre tense darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some timebr br Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcocks most memorable villains as the father-hating mother-fixated (but arent most of Hitchcocks villains mummys boys?) Bruno It is a disturbing stunning performance that illuminates the whole film His character is obsessive apparently homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how he is described as European) strangely charming and dangerous to cross Farley Granger certainly knows this as he becomes entangled in Brunos sordid web after the pair meet on a train Bruno knowing some inside information on Guys affairs proposes the two swap murders for each others benefit Walker will kill Grangers slutty conniving wife who is inhibiting his marriage to beautiful Anne whilst Granger will murder Brunos father who he so intensely hates Everyones happy right? A win-win as Bruno asserts? Wrong Granger forgets about the indecent proposal but an obsessed Walker doesnt He commits his murder and is determined to hound Granger until he completes his side of the bargain too Strangers becomes a riveting suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse in Hitchs capable handsbr br Hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes We have the whore Miriam Grangers estranged wife pregnant to another man She lasciviously slurps a phallic ice-cream cone whilst openly eating up Bruno with her eyes Barbara Morton Annes sister is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks youll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the 50s Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock ever made and it is typical to a Hitch film subtly sexual in detailbr br This fits into the film-noir category with its focus on murder lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography Walkers nut is one for the ages and Granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two and I never believed her relationship with Granger Still the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the BEST American films ever madebr br Just look at what Hitch does here- the originality the technical skill We see the murder of Miriam reflected in her shattered glasses A game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling intense scenes youll ever see A innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences A young boys balloon is popped callously by Walker (Hitch obviously liked what he saw in The Third Man!)Childrens delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming fast-paced terror Hitch subverts normal everyday events like no otherbr br The camera-work here is among the best ever seen in a Hitchcock film and the premise is to-die-for Its slick oozes sophistication and devilish charm The cross-cutting between Walker and Grangers characters is magnificent- Grangers do-or-die tennis match is just as vital as villain Walkers rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain Hitch again build his villain into a nasty repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming (Did anyone else find him strangely attractive more so than Granger?) piece of work- we are just as tense as Walker in our hope that he can get the lighter out of the drain We need him to anyway He holds the key to the storybr br Youll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this filmbr br Amazingbr br 1010
Well this is about as good as they come There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a compulsive technician -- or was he really deep Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean but its legitimate to ask if at his best he could not have been all three things at oncebr br In this one he seems to be about at his peak Hardly anything in it is accidental It abounds with doubt ambiguity and wit And the story is engrossing Patricia Highsmith apparently having complexes similar to Hitchcocks ownbr br Im sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so I wont bother going into it Ill just point out five on screen incidents that Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible forbr br Bruno Antony (Walker) has followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her Shes noticed his attention and is innocently flattered by itbr br 1 Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through The Tunnel of Love and then to an island in the center of the lake Walker is right behind them smiling in his boat -- Pluto Pluto Its not an allusion to the Walt Disney cartoon character Its a reference to Pluto also called Hades a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology This tiny touch cant be an accident And the underworld that Walker represents is not just a literal hell but the underworld of the human mind I hate to say hes a Jungian shadow but thats what he is (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive at the time of its release -- but probably not) 2 Now this is a deadly serious sequence right? Walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he doesnt even know Imagine the way this would have been laid out by most directors A night-time stalking through a crowded carnival stealing from shadow to shadow the killer peering from behind the canvas walls and so forth What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first comes through the gates concentrating on his victim a little boy in a cowboy suit holding a balloon runs up and shouts Bang! Bang! Youre dead! Walker jerks his head back in surprise and glares down indignantly at the kid And when the kid starts to walk away Walker darts his cigarette at the balloon and pops it then continues his pursuit without another glance Thats one way Hitchcock treats impending doombr br 3 The famous strangling reflected in the fallen eyeglasses which has been aped innumerable timesbr br 4 Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound with a big mallet sending a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to measure the strength of your blow One of her boyfriend whams it and the puck doesnt reach the bell at the top Under Miriams delighted and admiring gaze Walker smiles and rubs his hands together then picks up the mallet slams it down and the puck bangs against the bell Shes thrilled He puts the mallet down looks at her grins and WAGGLES HIS EYEBROWS at her like a ten-year-old showoff! 5 After the discovery of Miriams body while whistles blow and people shout Walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the curb Walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads him across the intersection gravely holding up his hand to stop the traffic A macabre jokebr br These incidents and others all take place during the ten or fifteen-minutes of the carnival visit (Robert Walkers performance is exceptional throughout) Its essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish (Cf: Ride the Pink Horse) But the menace of the scene is undercut by Hitchcocks insistence on irony and distance None of the familiar noir techniques are employed Theres nothing really creepy about it And the murder itself is hardly a savage one I dont think that any director other than Hitchcock would have handled it the way he did It would have been all menace and shadows hiding places abortive attempts scowls instead of grinsbr br Not that its an entirely flawless movie A flawless movie is not yet with us Some of the middle section is a bit slow going and Farley Granger although a nice guy is stolid dull and rather stupid His new girl friend is just dullbr br Hitchcock was to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly seriousness in The Wrong Man Im not sure Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt The latter was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education Original sin -- youre BORN with it -- and all that In filmed interviews he always glibly explained away his fear of the police and of authorities generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo Were justified in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a screen memory I hope you get the pun I know I know Its strained and inept but I spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up
Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry It is likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock was always attempting to push the envelope and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper more poignant motive on his mind Strangers on a Train one of Hitchcocks first and more underrated hits is a perfect example of these traits - an entertaining and suspenseful story even when viewed over 50 years later yes but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique br br Arguably one of the pioneering suspense thrillers Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 (if perhaps slightly less shocking) The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick careful editing are what really make the film stand out drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audiences focus even in slower scenes If there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments; every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion Sadly enough there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing - Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the films most tense and engaging scene These are only brief moments but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar filmbr br But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clichée after clichée its wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original Sure its fairly straightforward but the concept of swapping murders is simply one that would not fly in films of todays day and age which makes it all the more entertaining to watch; the films brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while One cant help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in humanitys heart demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder as well as Brunos own cavalier attitude towards death Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour (Bruno popping a childs balloon with his cigarette is priceless) and irony shooting suspenseful scenes in happy easy-going environments such as the iconic carnival scenes to create an even more eerie atmosphere This may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable br br The antagonistic figure of Bruno (essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker sadly in his last film role but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable as the character is a marvel to behold Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment Bruno is a calm controlled psychotic mess He speaks of murder in such an offhand tone yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people Bruno could seem to represent the Id as Freud would put it the inner darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure Guy Haines and how bland and uninteresting he seems almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing br br Yet despite this implied message Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome Its a testament to actor Farley Grangers talent that despite Robert Walkers villain easily stealing the show Grangers hero still comes across as sympathetic still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character Superb support is given by Ruth Roman who manages to overcome the clichée and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guys horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife and Patricia Hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than being simply the directors daughter would imply The superb cast (headed by a simply wonderful Walker) really bring the film to life adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcocks breathtaking stylistics br br All in all Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers but its still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems considering it was released half a century ago Once again Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique and the films surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience! br br -910
I have used this movie in my college Ethics courses for over 10 years (also Woody Allens Crimes and Misdemeanors--another terrific multi-leveled ethical study) br br Its fiction I dont focus too much on the unrealistic features of Strangers because all fictional films are obviously false on many levels I love the film as gallows comedy tautly told with many ironic twists and visual pleasures--even if its unbelievable The story is told so well that I dont even think of criticizing its plausibility (although I must confess that the tennis match seems the weakest part to me--too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition)br br Some problems presented in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and ethical discussion:br br 1 Ethical Passivity: some weaknesses of the Guy character are intended by Hitchcock A primary ethical insight of the film is the danger of inability to articulate ones moral positions Guy is unable to effectively block Brunos crazy proposals at the start An interesting question is why and how does Guy behave so passively ineffectively? A possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process br br 2 Miscommunication: Guy commits another failure at the start: on the train to get away quickly he agrees that Brunos ideas are all good But Guys literal meaning is opposite to his inflected sarcastic meaning Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss-cross murders Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement To some extent near the beginning Bruno may be partially pretending that an agreement has been struck to draw Guy further into a web of complicity Bruno is manipulating Guy; Guys linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno a chance to put an ethical stranglehold on Guy Bruno manipulating Guy may also take on other meanings    br br 3 Secrecy: Some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno It seems at first ridiculous especially since Guy appears obviously heterosexual in his relationships with Miriam and Anne However remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women Guy appears (stereotypically--its 1951 remember) effeminate especially in relationship to Bruno Guy the strong athlete is weak on the inside Bruno is also conflicted (playing against himself) appearing facially and physically strong at first but then displaying some effeminate traits (Brunos fashion and footwork; his gushing emotionally to Guy in different situations; his receiving a manicure from his doting mother; Bruno kissing and desperately fondling his mothers hand; other more subtle gay stereotypes that hold cryptic meaning from Hitchcocks point of view) I wish I could hear Hitchcock clarify his intended meanings herebr br 4 Dishonesty and Distrust: Guy makes some colossal blunders in hiding truths about Bruno from family and from police Guy fails to fully comprehend that admitting fault quickly may be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession Again Guy is driven by passivity insecurity fear--and perhaps a self-hate that is closer to Brunos own self-loathing than we care to see or to admit Both Guy and Bruno act out their own parables of impotencebr br 5 Lack of Evidence: Guy feels a problem mustering the evidence to acquit himself While quickly going to the police would solve a huge problem Guy traps himself with his own doubts and insecurities: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on Guys behalf; the obsessive need to appear politically pristine; and other personality factors that cause Guy to feel defenseless He is as dysfunctional as Bruno--just not as dangerous (yet one could partially blame Guy for Miriams murder)br br 6 Disease and Mental Disorder: an interesting question is how legally responsible is Bruno for the murders? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath the more guilty Guy may be as someone healthy who failed to stand up and morally act to prevent the crimes Guys failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and death ensues One could argue that more than one crime is committed and that Guy is an emotionally hobbled accomplicebr br These and many other features of the film make Strangers on a Train a gem of a morality play a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections
This is such a revered and studied film a classic among Hitchcocks many it takes no cajoling to want to watch it again Yet you think: can it hold up even when the huge (and clever and amazing) trick of the plot is no surprise?br br Yesbr br And for starters there is the start a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story the gist of it Two taxis two men shown with their shoes each walking onto the train sitting then across from each other and oops a mistake a little nudge and the conversation begins and we see the men themselves They are interchangeable br br The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock as it is in many horror and suspense films-- cheery and light We know entering the film however that this wont be the case so already we are worried What after all is about to go wrong?br br A lot In truly Hitchcock fashion it is a purely innocent man (nearly always a man) who faces injustice who is trapped by circumstance threatening what is most valuable to him The innocent in this case tennis player Guy Haynes is played with an innocence that is believable--his collegiate politeness in that first scene for example as he realizes the other man is a little cuckoo is just what you or I might do The not-so-innocent man is the self- absorbed and scarily intelligent spoiled child Bruno Anthony played with utter brilliance by Robert Walker (This uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock wacko played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho) So from scene one on the train (and the train really gorgeous!) we have the two leads and we have the mind-blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith who also wrote the books behind the two Mr Ripley movies And it doesnt hurt that the screenplay was co- written by Raymond Chandler himself who knows something about economy and clever dialog And crimebr br And of course there is more than just the first scene What to note? Well that smarty of a senators daughter (I thought she was terrific) is Hitchcocks daughter Patricia who is still with us (as of 2009; she also had a role in Psycho) And there is a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film--the tennis courts in the Hamptons known to us as the site of the US Open The fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady montage building up the suspense by making it surreal The fear gets positively fattening with the laughing children and the old man crawling underneath it all And when it collapses in a crash--thats all backprojected on a set one of the more naturalistic uses by a director known for not worrying about the realism of his back projectionsbr br The photography is that perfect Hollywood stunning without becoming so stylized (as in some noir films) that it is an object in its own right Look again at the first scene or the shooting (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder This is sophisticated construction When we are not completely surprised that its Bruno in the bed that only proves that the director has us on our toes Something unexpected is always expectedbr br Are there glitches? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falseness you can accept (or embrace) as beautiful style The scene where Bruno is choking the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman played by Norma Varden is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away) and marred by his looking at the senators daughter and being triggered into a deadly trance by her glasses and her resemblance to his earlier victim This is a mid-20th Century idea of psychology that intrudes on many of Hitchcocks efforts (The end of Psycho for starters)br br The Wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the movie from the main characters to the murder victim and the senators daughter This echoes in lots of little ways--two men trail him to the tennis court two men accompany the victim to the amusement park and so on There can be too much made of this but it does supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness Dont forget there are meant to be two murders--it is the lack of the second murder the inability to create a doubling in that case that causes Bruno to unravelbr br Walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot and just afterwards he died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts Though he appeared in other films Strangers on a Train is easily his tour-de- force Farley Granger had a long career that never quite saw him break into true stardom though his style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works especially in They Live by Night br br And if you watch this one for the first or third time do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowds heads all move back and forth in unison-- except for Brunos He is staring out without moving his head straight at us As the trailer for the movie says after this movie you wont be talking to strangers on a train
br br Lets swap Murders- your wife my father- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey Guy a solid respectable tennis player whose problem is that his wife the flirtatious Miriam wont divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne laughs the whole conversation off as a joke The following week he isnt laughing any more In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her As he does her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses Cold hearted and amoral Bruno his part of the deal completed approaches an appalled Guy expecting even pressuring him into doing his bit Matters are not helped when Annes precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting Guy of Miriams murder So accused of a murder he didnt commit and expected to commit another what is Guy going to do? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature - and this Hitchcock does to perfection
In Strangers On A Train its obvious from the start that playboy wastrel Robert Walker has singled out Farley Granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders Grangers a semi-public figure hes a tennis pro but not an especially high one High enough however for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Romanbr br So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them complete strangers did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise Though Granger is repulsed by the idea one of the beautiful things about this film is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger just might submit to temptationbr br In fact when Walker kills Laura Elliot Grangers wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man he expects that Granger will in turn murder Walkers father so that Walker can inherit his estate Today Walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at thatbr br Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role ironically in his last complete film Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished Hitchcock does not do too bad by Farley Granger either br br Of course when Granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him the tension Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing first in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and waylay Walker before he plants evidence convicting Granger at the crime scene And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Grangerbr br Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his best it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing
Strangers on a Train was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing I finally watched it a few weeks ago and as always with any Hitchcock movie it not only stood up to the test of time it far surpassed most thrillers being made today You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bonts Speed Of course Strangers is over forty years older than Speed and contains no modern special effects but the visceral thrill is there - Hitchcock was a true geniusbr br The not-so-subtle gay side of Bruno (Robert Walker in an amazing performance) has taken form in many other psycho-stalker-figures in future movies Consider him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in Single White Female He knows about Guy before he even meets him on the train - we almost get the feeling their contact isnt incidental - and is soon entirely obsessed with himbr br Hitchcock loved the Oedipial elements in his movies (also see Psycho for more blatant undertones) and theres a lot of that here Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother His effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951 when gays were not allowed to be portrayed on the screen - yet Hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see Bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non-masculine robe flirting with Guy and responding to his motherbr br The deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller than you can return to again and again - unfortunately its being remade as a big-budget Hollywood production but after seeing the original I honestly cant imagine anything surpassing the sheer white-knuckle thrills of this movie
Even though some unrealistic things happen at the end (ie a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry-go-round where any number of innocent could be killed) this still was an intense enjoyable thriller one of Alfred Hitchcocks better films Robert Walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times His co-star in here Farley Granger is okay but is no match for Walker either in acting or in the characters they play Its the typical Hitchcock film with some strange camera angles immoral themes innocent man gets in trouble etc Unlike a lot of his other films I thought this one was a fast-moving story with a very few dull spots Being an ex-tennis player I enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies Hitchcocks real-life daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here She didnt just get the job because of her dad; she can act Also of note: the DVD has both the British and American versions and there were some differences in the story This is a classic film that is still referred to in modern-day films even comedies such as Throw Momma Off The Train
Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigos and the Psychos is this film; Strangers on a Train the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made The story follows Guy Haines a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senators daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife One day on the way to see his wife he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall; and one that could ultimately cost him his lifebr br The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinemas most intriguing and thought provoking of all time What if two people swapped murders thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant? Could this truly be the perfect murder? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any normal everyday person Everyone has someone theyd like to get rid of so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his? The chances of it happening are unlikely but its the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train; and in this situation anyone could br br Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker? The man was simply born for the part He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in The character of Bruno is a madman but hes not a lunatic; hes a calculating conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable His performance is extremely malevolent and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality Unfortunately Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train and I believe that is a great loss to cinema Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger Granger never really impresses that much but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; and that is how it should be Ruth Roman is Guys wife to be She isnt really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she makes the best of what she has Alfred Hitchcocks daughter Patricia takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara the sister of Guys fiancé She is suitably lovely in this role and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is inbr br Alfred Hitchcocks direction is always sublime and it is very much so in this film There is one shot in particular that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses This is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene Hitchcocks direction is moody throughout and very much complies with the film noir style The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting and I dont think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film Its truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie; but it works There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time and the reason for that is that he doesnt only use the script to tell the films story but he also uses to camera to do so as well Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking and is sure to delight any fan of cinema A masterpiece
One would have expected Hitchcocks return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution Surely few expected his most riotous unrestrained film a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy exciting suspense mocking manipulation and astonishing flights of fancy But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAINbr br What is remarkable is how much Brunos transgression disrupts the world of the film Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life and hence the society he represents or is eager to join Guy is the archetypal American the working-class boy made good moving in influential circles athletic successful handsome Bruno is his destructive opposite gay decadent European (he lives off his father in a Big House and just lounges about dreaming of murder) Brunos life is one of repetition circularity whereas Guy moves straight ahead It is Brunos achievement to move Guy into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force HIM to transgress (break the law hope for murder (Brunos))br br Bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy All the authority figures in the film are criticised - Brunos father a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in Aunt Claras paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Annas incredibly Machiavellian self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken Far from being the mother-hater of legend Hitch as Robin Wood perceived is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchybr br Brunos transgression turns the world topsy-turvy This is Hitchs most surreal film Whenever Guy is in his plot he is filmed straight with conventionally romantic music But whenever Bruno intrudes the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque bizarre much more fun This is Hitchs first truly American film revelling in the primitive detritus of Americana Grown men puncture little boys balloons or try to throw them off merry-go-rounds Distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains Elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees Washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky like a haunting Dali painting There is one of the greatest and funniest scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless smiling Bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match an image worthy of Magritte Just look at any scene with Bruno in it and watch it derail into the bizarrebr br Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (Hitch had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in more staid environs: Washington will never look the same again STRANGERS is also VERTIGO notwithstanding Hitchs most overtly sexual film - as well as the phalluses there is the sustained homoeroticism the remarkable play with riding horses; the gobsmacking fellatio joke when Hitchs daughter spills powder over the policemanbr br And yet Hitch doesnt stint on good old suspense In the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates and Hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification willing Bruno into murder There is a hilariously painful sequence where Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame Guy down a drain The gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience I was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny slightly disturbing and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success And Hitch milks it with callous glee - listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions and kick yourself for taking it all so seriouslybr br STRANGERS is one of Hitchs five best films and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema The dialogue is so strange and brilliant I cant believe it wasnt written by Chandler Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imp standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts Guy The fairground finale is a remarkable dizzying fusion of exciting tense set-piece black comedy and symbolic site If Brunos final words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic precepts Hitch is supposed to embody: compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS) we applaud his integrity infinitely preferable to Guys debased serving of self
Cam Archers lyrical Bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt) that is more vibe than narrative Caught somewhere between documentary and dream Bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of early Todd Haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of Gus van Sant With grit glamour and heartbreak its kinda like the movie equivalent of Sonic Youth playing bubblegum pop
Beautifulthat one word pretty much sums up this whole film Everything from the cinematography the directing the actingbrilliant At any point of the film you can pause it and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or artsy fartsy as some people would say I assure you that after one viewing Bobbycrush will be stuck in your head I know this from first hand experience Even the soundtrack is great It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film Be thankful that Cam Archer exists in this world We need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) imagery
Dylan and Bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are But Dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside Bobby knows that hes not interested in girls and misses what he had with Dylan br br Told as part cheesy 80s pop video part home movie part video recollection this film tells a confusing and sad but all too often true story that will hit home with many that see it br br This film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true chord with me but I wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note Yes we all love and lose even when we are young but theres always tomorrow especially when we are young
Very enjoyable 50s Western I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fansbr br Mostly Victor Matures movie and quite well done in my estimationbr br Hes a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions They all joined as scouts after their lossbr br Victor has set his eyes on the Colonels wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulationsbr br Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other charactersbr br 50s Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction A Western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again One to enjoy Gave it a 7 rating Likely 68 worthy but films like these become more precious over timebr br For film-noir fansThe Big Steal They Live By Night Side Street are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed Bought and viewed Noir seems to resemble Westerns in a way Some long ago and never forever
I enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline All the main characters are well cast True John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well but Victor Mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling Tarzan of sorts Reminds me of his film role as Samson another difficult but not impossible man to tamebr br The mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts This story supposedly takes place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene(probably Mt Lassen) the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the Cascades as we never see any other civilians However there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort is the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in Wyoming and Montana Fort Laramie(eastern Wyoming)is mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort The plains tribe of Assiniboines is mentioning as joining Red Cloud This aspect of the story then bears a general resemblance to historical factbr br It may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of John Fords Fort Apache In both cases we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with Native American problems He underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career In both films he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy Also in common the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do In both films we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commanders heart and a subordinate which the commander does everything to squelch Clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completionbr br I also see certain resemblances with The Misfits The soldiers as a whole including the commander are misfits of a sort((as one of them admits): mostly they have problems or are raw recruits with no experience fighting Native Americans The commanders wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort thus is inherently a misfit with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army The trappers in turn are also misfits not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army-generated antagonism by Red Cloud br br Finally we can also compare this story with Anthony Manns later film The Far Country starring Jimmy Stewart In Stewarts case he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end But Matures character doesnt come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss Red Cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate Besides he has an obsession with the Commanders wife
Victor Mature as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper may be on the poster but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to get cut to ribbons by Confederate artillery at Shiloh and is sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence has the most interesting part married to a young and hard to recognize at first Anne Bancroft The uncivilized Mature lusts for the colonels wife giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another mans wife at one point by James Whitmore who plays Matures older and wiser mountain man father figure Directed by Anthony Mann this film is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart but even so you really dont need the Indian menace to make this a film worth seeing although Preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the Indians under submission in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout
this is another good westernwhich i enjoyedits not an epic or anythingbut it is good for what it isit about 3 fur trappersled by a men named Jedwho is crude and uncivilizedJed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and Indian bandwho resent the Americans on their landand want to take it backthats the gist of the storywhat follows is actionexcitementeven a bit of humourand forbidden romanceone of Jeds friendsGusreminded me a lot of the character Quint(played by Robert Shaw)in the movie Jawsthey both have that crustygruff demeanoranywayif youre a western fanyou should find lots to like about this particular entryi think it deserves a 710
One of the more obscure of Anthony Manns Westerns The Last Frontier was also his only cavalry Western (aside from one brief episode in Winchester 73) though naturally he focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a Fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals Set not in his beloved high country but in the foothills and forests its a much more cynical view of life of the frontier in many ways his Fort Apache without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost is made up of misfits failures cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors badly led while the Civil War takes priority and all the best the army has to offerbr br Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free trappers who find civilisation creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and packhorses by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the Cavalry into their territory Rather than blame the Indians for their losses they decide its the armys fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead But despite the best efforts of Guy Madisons amiable and competent acting commander to bring Mature into the 19th Century and make him fit to wear the uniform the arrival of Robert Prestons humiliated Colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost  and Matures clumsy infatuation with the Colonels wife (Anne Bancroft too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman whos tired of being saved by men who think they know whats best for her)  soon drive matters into much darker territory Its not long before some of the soldiers are busily planning on killing each other both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them: little wonder that at one point Mature throws away the bluecoat he has long coveted in disgust screaming I would have died for this but its nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag! The Stallone of his day Mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director This is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part perversely enough as a simple man  well-meaning but drunk violent uneducated and with a unsubtle almost childlike lust for life the part seems designed with Burt Lancaster in mind with some striking similarities to his character in The Kentuckian But Robert Prestons Ahab-like Colonel is clearly the best role determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal Civil War engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board In his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption driven as much by his sense of shame at his wifes sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he regards as his inferiors Hes beyond salvation but theres still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity  he genuinely admires Madisons courage in making a futile attempt to get Prestons orders countermanded by their superiors  fatally skewed though it isbr br Like its hero the film is a little rough around the edges (and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any Western) but that only tends to make it more interesting and there are plenty of Manns typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive Unfortunately the deficiencies of the early CinemaScope lenses are very apparent in Columbias DVD with the image often dark (255:1 CinemaScope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early Scope films show a lot of trial-and-error) and grainy
br br The Last Frontier is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed (Victor Mature) Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison) Colonel Marston(Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston colonels wife (Anne Bancroft) Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians Jed Gus and Mungo adjust to living the civilized life within a fort on the edge of the last frontier Jed who has been raised by Gus both inspires and looks up to the older Gus and Mungo and has an especially difficult time dealing with civilization His real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonels wife Corrina Colonel Marstonis a reckless man who endangers every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent Corrina a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is Caught in the middle is Captain Riordon a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonels recklessness br br What makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of The Last Frontier are EXACTLY the same elements (forget the insipid title and dated music)br br First the screenplay Almost all of the subplots (particularly the reckless Colonel) have been done better elsewhere but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity Just when you THINK you know what is going to happen next this one takes off in a DIFFERENT direction POSSIBLE SPOILER: The Last Frontier being a Production Code movie (back in the day the word virgin was taboo) its very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature tolerant manner I expected either Jed or the colonels wife to reap some retribution for their sin I was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didnt exploit that expectation to create a less predictable endingbr br Second the casting Mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of Jed the wild-eyed innocent raised in the woods James Whitmore who plays Gus the man who raised Jed is actually five years younger than Mature Nevertheless Mature is very endearing playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid Although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time (most notably Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas) none could have played Jed better Preston (also Matures junior) plays Colonel Marston missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man However Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in Marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonels rank Bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as Corrina Bancrofts dark hair has been died blonde and this achieves the same effect as it did for Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands) and Christina Ricci (Sleepy Hollow) That is I felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why; I believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades Further Bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness (here the blonde hair softens her up a bit though) This enables the 24 year old Bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old Mature and the 37 year old Preston; yep she could be a colonels wife Madison walks a careful balancing act as Riordan handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialoguePlaying a role similar to that of John Wayne in Fort Apache Madison does a more skillful job at itbr br This movie has a Silverado type camaraderie That alone makes it worth seeing It also has memorable performances beautiful scenerary and great action and direction I just hope a letterbox version is available (many have been lost) because this movie takes full advantage of that format
Ordinarily Anthony Mann made westerns with the big guys - James Stewart Gary Cooper Henry Fonda    the A list cowboy stars But in this B+ film he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western The main character played by Victor Mature is a trapper mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men Not here For once a true mountain man - vulgar crude animalistic - is the central figure and its something to see giving Mature one of his better later roles The real acting chops are provided by Robert Preston excellent as a self-absorbed Custer type cavalry commander and James Whitmore the poor mans Spencer Tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile Indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officers wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of Matures grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that shes attracted to him Rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache The battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format Good show and underrated movie all around
A very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution Ian McShane is right at home playing the soul loving DJ who gets canned because he wont  go along with the program  and sets out to let the world know what theyre missing The supporting cast is great as well and the music is the Soul of the film I just wish that the film would be released so that I could get a copy of this for my film library
The sort of little film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore Sort of a soul version of the more well-known The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as Isaac Hayes as well as acting stalwarts Taurean Blacque Derrick OConnor and Antonio Fargas Not meant to be an epic by any means this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold
Better than average World War II-era who-dun-it featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight Crime Doctors Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems The link to courage is not particularly clearbr br This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but Dr Ordway labels murder Hillary Brooke plays the part of widow Kathleen Carson who is involved with Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage As a mystery novelist Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor as is Lloyd Corrigan as an aficionado in crimebr br Spooky houses with creaking doors caskets in the cellar and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good Direction production design and photography stand out The exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average B detective thrillerbr br Strongly recommended
Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [#410] with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid Spanish American backdrops and sets And a more off-the-wall storyline too!br br A man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party The Crime Doctor is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over for one of them did the deed Was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife the 3rd wife and rich widow Hilary Brooke the dancing brother and sister vampires the intense young man the eccentric cabinet maker Lloyd Corrigan on loan from Boston Blackie the irreplaceable butler or odds-on Jerome Cowan? Police Inspector Emory Parnell had his work cut out but Warner Baxter as Ordway was as unflappable as ever in working it all out One of the goofs listed on the IMDb is wrong: On breaking into the murder room Ordway says Right through the centre of the forehead and Cowan replies He didnt miss this time Favorite bits: Baxter and Cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party; The scene where the Bragas place of repose is seemingly rumbled The plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of Monogram but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldnt do either!br br Well worth a watch if you already like the genre you wont be disappointed unless you really dont like the genre
I saw this on TCM recently and through the IMDb I found that there were seven Crime Doctor movies with Warner Baxter as the psychiatrist-detective Baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier Not noir and a bit campy today the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural The plot black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the Mr Moto and Charlie Chan series There are subplots unexpected twists and appearances by a number of B movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately (none ever made it to the A status) It is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutesbr br I would love to see a boxed DVD series of these films
Note: After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the original film My mistake I thought IMDb for a database for movies not TV shows But since most people will look up this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM which strangely is the name this film is listed under on IMDb Ill leave this comment herebr br Maybe I missed something but when I read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the CBS series -- which must have been loosely based on this film I did not see the TV series and I might like it or not but one thing I am sure is that it is very different than this film This film is NOT like a TV show at all and Whoopie Goldberg is not in it or any other famous Hollywood stars (other than Jack Palance who was very charming in his role)br br This is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks outside the box It is not at all like a Hollywood formula movie which is probably why the (whats a nice word for idiots?) who decide to market movies or not decided not to market this onebr br First of all this movie captured my heart and imagination from the get-go From the music (which is just part of the time so you cant really call it a musical) to the cinematography to the really cool storybr br A German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and quite plump) gets in an argument with the other German or Bavarian man with whom she is traveling through the California desert with and parts ways with him --he taking off in the car and she left to fend for herself on a deserted and desert-like highway out in the middle of nowherebr br She finds the small and dilapidated but charming Bagdad Cafe in Bagdad California and checks in The rest of the story is magic I dont want to try to describe this film because I want you to enjoy every surprisebr br Warning: If you are a racist or have something against big women you will not like this movie as the main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have large roles and are included as part of the mix without any racism involvedbr br I gave this film a 10 for orginality entertainment and sheer delightfulness
You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940sbr br On top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags the plot is as far-fetched as the tales The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it But then thats how unrealistic the comedy isbr br But--if youre a true Red Skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the 40s--you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting him Ann Rutherford and Virginia Grey do nicely as his love interest and Conrad Veidt as always makes an interesting villain One of his more amusing moments is his reaction to Skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans I never knew that he muses impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introducedbr br All in all typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are Not always easy for a discriminating viewer as many of them simply fall flat the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one-liners has simply worn off
Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as The Fox in Whistling in the Dark also starring Ann Rutherford Conrad Veidt Eve Arden Virgina Grey and Rags Ragland Wally Benton aka The Fox finds his plans to marry his fiancé Carol (Rutherford) thwarted when hes kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult (Veidt) Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult The Silver Haven is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old womans nephew who is going to be living off of the interest He wants Wally to devise a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the airplane en route to meet with his attorney For backup and because hes not sure which one is Wallys fiancé Jones kidnaps Carol and also the radio sponsors daughter (Grey)br br This to me anyway is a superior film to the second entry in this series Whistling in Dixie The plot is better the cast is better there is less slapstick and fewer corny jokes Skelton when hes not making faces and rolling his eyes is quite amiable and Rutherford is very good Veidt always played these evil men to perfection Eve Arden is Wallys agent who arranges a date for him and Grey to make sure his contract is renewed I had only seen Grey in films from the 1950s onward She was always a good-looking woman but who knew she was such a knockout in the 30s and 40s? This is a fun film with a neat cast
There are 3 of these movies all similarly crafted and each extremely amusing Red plays radio sleuth Wally Benton aka The Fox who gets wrangled into solving real life crimes along with his fiance played by your typical wartime girl next door looker Ann Rutherford Many of the one-liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s which I anticipated But just as many actually made me laugh out loud which was unexpected to say the least Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence surprising I say because I grew up with a much older version of the man whos charm really didnt play well in my formidable years I have to give these movies the go ahead though -if your in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare I almost threw in light hearted but in truth people get wasted and beaten up and dare i say it the suspense at times is well above average As with most movies from this era it gets a PI (politically incorrect) rating for reasons you can well imagine Wartime is funny that way I guess and so then again are these movies Watch one watch them all
Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton who plays The Fox on a radio show He writes the murder mysteries and as The Fox solves them Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone He kidnaps Benton his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey) He tells Benton to write out the perfect murderor his girlfriends get itbr br Very funny and enjoyable movie Fast-moving (its only 77 minutes) a good script and perfect casting really puts this across Skelton is very good in his first starring role--very funny fast handsome and intelligent Veidt is excellent as the evil Jones Rutherford and Grey are lots of fun as Skeltons girlfriends All three of them play off each other perfectly--their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small rolebr br Well worth your time
While many pass this off as a B movie it is indeed a first class comedy that is well-written and acted Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton better known to radio fans as The Fox Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wallys fiance Carol Lambert Conrad Veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals I read one account of this movie which states that Vincente Minelli directed this film not unless he changed his name to S Sylvan Simon who directed all three of the Fox movies This is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged So get over your black and white prejudice if you have one sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy This was also Reds first starring role Take note during the climax of the reference to Orson Welles War Of the Worlds broadcast
Is there any question that Jeffrey Combs is one of the true horror greats? This movie seriously doesnt suck and is sort of funny Watching a young Combs at work is great but I wish he had had more lines Look out for Beyond Re-Animator Its going to kick some azz
Look this movie is obscure brilliant and a classic that should sought out by any means necessary I suppose the powers that be have decided that it will forever be relegated towards the bargin bin; nevertheless we could only pray for the chance to see this one on DVD I would say that it even beats the great Phatasm If you like a dark movie with plenty of spooky imagery look for this one and see how an 80s horror movie is suppose to be
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack A bunch of drama school students steal Radzoffs corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it Radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave Writerdirector Norman Thaddeus Vane concocts a fresh original and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise offers a neat evocation of the glitzy Hollywood milieu and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere The kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods with a gal being set on fire a juicy decapitation (the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it!) and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights Kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar B-flick faces: Mayne has a deliciously eye-rolling ball with his flashy role Leon Askin contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed-up director Wolfgang Nita Talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium Mrs Rohmer plus there are nice turns by Luca Bercovici as jerky drama student ringleader Saint Jennifer Starrett as the sweet Meg Jeffrey Combs as the geeky Stu and Scott Thomson as the nerdy Bobo Popping up in cool bits are Chuck Porky Mitchell as a detective Patrick Wright in one of his customary policeman parts and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse Joel Kings polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look The moody score by Jerry Mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot A fun little fright flick
Ugh what an embarrassing episode last night! It was either a failed script for ABC Afterschool Special or the product of an earnest rookie writer just out of college making an homage to that classic PC anti-gun homily from 1974 The Gun In fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasnt of The Gun being melted down like in the movie!br br No Im not some NRA shill Its just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that I should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal Cause Id appreciate it if the lecture at least wasnt delivered via 2-by-4 Geez!br br OK the sociology lesson is over The Message has been delivered The Important Episode has been aired Now lets get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence
I have never missed an episode David Morse is a wonderful actor and I am hoping that this show can survive It certainly beats out that CSI crap I love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday I give the show a 10
AhhI didnt order no amazing hit showWell you got one Hack is simply the greatest television show ever made A little bit of me died when I flicked on the tv one Friday night to catch a little Hack and it wasnt on The show dug deep into key social issues of our culture I found that at the end of any episode I watched; I walked away having been both entertained and informed I am actually dumber now that Hack is gone I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate Since Hack has been gone I see them as eyesores and an unneeded strain on taxpayers So for the love of God we need to bring back Hack!
Hes not your conventional cab driverbr br This guys got issues With his wife with his son a priest all his fares his ex-partner and most of all himself And the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it So we have to keep watching to find out more about his pastbr br The idea may not be original but David Morse makes it so I think this is a great show and I hope people catch-on before the seasons over br br WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!
This is NOT your run-of-the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases The episodes so far are more realistic and intelligentbr br If you are looking for something with a lot of butt-kicking Rambo-style cop story you will not find it herebr br I gave it a 9 I wish this series lives long Morse is excellent!
Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetchedwell maybe a do-good cab driver in Philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met) but thats what makes the show greatbr br The fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun Its highly watchable and even though u know Mike wins out in the end he never wins in life David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role His supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great!br br All in all I watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action I watch this show because its got great acting a good premise and a great story-line every week Its also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by or know what intersection hes at I Love this show and I love Philly!! Give this show a shot!
It is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change! As an added bonus it is nice to see some local home boys from Massachusetts making good in LA I hope this show will be a keeper
An extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast One of the few shows that I try to watch on a regular basis Glad to see Bebe Neuwirth in a recurring role but feel Andre Braugher is underutilized He is one intense actor! Hope CBS gives it a better time slot next season
Okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again! Week in week out David Morses character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but whats wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven!!br br Due to the lack of love for this show by many I cant see it going to a season series - but you never know? The amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - lets hope something good can make it past a first series!!!
I like Hack Think the Lone Ranger reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver a decent but flawed guy in Philadelphia doing his best while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past and youve got the synopsis David Morse is nearly perfect as Olshansky He helps people but instead of riding Silver in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary Philly without handing out silver bullets The supporting cast is first class and well above average At times the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series The Rockford Files This show deserves a return hopefully in a better time slot than 9PM Friday(eastern)
I love this show Its clever and very well acted David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry The writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief After every new episode Im always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is My only complaint would be Donna Murphys absence at this point in the second season As David Morse ex-wife Heather she added such character to the showbr br I think this show is a credit to the crimedrama genre With that said - I can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating Would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique?
I am sick of series with young and clueless people talking about their problems all the time self centered boring and absolutely annoying (Popular; Dawsons Creek; Beverly Hills; etc) Hack is a breath of fresh air with a great actor (David Morse) a completely different plot credible people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very very good histories I just love it!! I hope Hack will go on for a long time because it is a great television series for grown up people for a change
David Morse and Andre Braugher are very talented actors which is why Im trying so hard to support this program Unfortunately an irrational plot and very poor writing is making it difficult for me Im hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them
I have only see three episodes of Hack starring David Morse and it looks as though Ive missed 37 episodes! well thats if ITV 3 are showing them in chronological order Ive just watched Misty Blue (episode 38) I have really enjoyed the 3 episodes but then Im a David Morse fan (esp St Elsewhere) For any one reading this Hack is excellent Pity its being aired on ITV 3 The cast is strong though I cant get used to the idea of David playing a bent cop still we all know hes the good guy wrongly accused I see Gary Cole has guest starred what ever happened to Midnight Caller? Just wonder if Hack is available on DVD (yet) Lovin it Cheers
Hey I didnt order no cab! Yeah well you got one What can I say about Hackwhat a man among men He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold If you were able to (and fortunately for Americas TV viewersone person per week was) penetrate the cold hard surface of Hacks exterior you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice The show was superb I laughed I cried I smiledall in the same episode My arms would break out in goosebumps when our dear friend Hack would exit his cab in another dark alleywith nothing more than his fistsready to avenge a wronged civilian A smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark alleys facial expressions when the Taxi of Justices headlights illuminated upon his face Week after week I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to bask in the warmth glow of Hacks brilliance I have never seen a better show and I mourned the loss of one of Americas greatest treasures when the show was canceled In other Hack-related news I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I are expecting Hack Koen to come into the world in about three weeks
It seems that Hack has been described as un-realistic but thats what TV is TV is meant to provide an escape from everyday life and I feel Hack does a great job in that regard Add to this the slow process of revealing his past and engaginginteresting plots; you just cant seem to get enough Plus with such great actors as David Morse Andre Braugher and even little Mathew Borish what more can you ask for So if you are looking for an involving experience and have a liking for underdog characters I suggest giving Hack a chance especially now that its finally getting off its feet
To keep it as simple as possible This is a very good show That is well written and has a fantastic cast Its not loaded with blood and guts And centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife his son his former partner (Andre Braugher) his childhood friend now a priest (George Dzunzda) and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode Are you likely to find something like this going on in your city NO Is this still a good story YES And its nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of his flaws Watch more then one ( 2-3) and youll see why a lot of us are hooked on this show And thank you David Morse for making this character so interesting Another good job!
I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary then later felt different about it I would return and make known my change of heart So far this is the first time its happened br br Im really starting to enjoy Hack Something has clearly changed The storylines seem to be much stronger The plot may still be a tad surreal but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven I attribute this to fine acting br br Not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner Some need time to pick up speed Im glad I kept watching this program and I really hope it lasts
I am not a fan of musicals but I am a huge fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even expecting greatness from the classic director This movie is BEAUTIFUL The shots are like oil paintings with motion something a lot of directors strive for but Renoir MASTERS I cannot express how much this movie transcends itself its not really a musical it just has a couple of well-placed musical numbers and a grand dancing finale But there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute JOY when watching itbr br I am a fan of foreign art films but Im also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies I get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in la la land but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible -- not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good 10 out of 10
As a longtime admirer of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge and a more recent admirer of Jean Renoirs film-making I knew that Id inevitably watch his French Cancan sooner or later The movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub The impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to turn Montmartre laundress Nini (Françoise Arnoul) into a cancan star without arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress the belly-dancing Lola (Maria Felix) This is just one of several love triangles in French Cancan--true to stereotype these French showbiz folk are always falling in lovebr br Renoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie Gabin perfectly incarnates the aging French playboy hero Arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously usedbr br French Cancan is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage etc only one character Casimir ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation The actor who plays him Philippe Clay is fun to watch--a really tall skinny young man who sings dances and does contortionsbr br The movie ends with a long cancan sequence as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together The dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in Moulin Rouge; in fact if I have one complaint about French Cancan its that the whole thing is a little too Technicolor Even when Nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song the lighting is bright and flat no shadows intruding Yes the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy; its just that I cant help thinking that things werent ever this colorful and innocent in real life
Like classic Hollywood musicals the plot is just an excuse A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancanbr br Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and setsbr br Consider it Jean Renoirs love letter to the Paris he grew up in Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who dont like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productionsbr br 
This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall In many ways this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s in that it has many clichés leading up to the inevitable conclusion (will the show STILL go on?) While of course none of this is new it was enjoyable and well made The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD In real life Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film But in FRENCH CANCAN the characters have fully functioning libidos--but nothing is really shown so the movie is okay for kidsbr br Nothing new but well done nevertheless
I just viewed Jean Renoirs wonderful film French Can Can It is a visual delight and a great entertainment The recently produced Moulin Rouge pales by comparison I didnt quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received Now Im convinced more than ever that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like Jean Renoirs version of the same story He succeeded in getting great performances out of his entire cast and the great French actor Jean Gabin was in rare form The dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting one Id ever seen It was long but I didnt want it to end This film deserves to receive more recognition than its got
Jean Renoirs homage to the Paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways Not only does it appear to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha it portrays the geographic Paris; the streets accessible only by staircases the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by Hollywood There is an obvious comparison to be made with Lloyd Bacons 42nd Street which had been made about 20 years before featuring Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation a fresh-faced kid from the sticks who had come to New York to get into show business who saves the show when the star fails--Youre going out there a kid from the chorus but youve got to come back a STAR!! Warner Baxters Julian Marsh is a director who suffers for his art and is unappreciated Jean Gabins Danglard keeps running afoul of genital politics but when he talks about the show he is more like Knute Rockne than like Julian Marsh Hes all about the game except--for his pointy thing He has a profitable new venture sewed up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as his next mistress His prospects rise and fall with every coital journey he takes br br Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro played by Maria Felix) slumming to a dive where he sees Nini (Françoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover Paulo the baker and discovers that she is a spirited dancer He uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage The prospect of money and fame charms Nini and she become Danglards next mistress as well as an apt student of the cancan which Danglard has dubbed French Cancan to cater to the current Anglophile tendency in the dancebr br Both 42nd St and French Cancan are tributes to show business--to modern entertainment--that has is own iconography and its own conceit 42nd St is centered around Julian Marsh a great director of Broadway shows which he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement The male juvenile is a middle-aged twit with lumbago replaced by Dick Powell the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide Danglard on the other hand goes from woman to woman seducing them with the promise of fame hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment One has no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active Postcoital scenes aboundbr br Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo he has discovered Esther a Piaf type and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the films theme song while he plays it on her fiddle That of course arouses Ninis jealousy just as she has aroused the jealousy of Lola (And of course Nini had already forsworn the privilege of being a Czarina!) The whole movie is about how Danglards concupiscence has cost him money but how even his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the show--how the audience demands devotion--and it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men At the movies conclusion Danglard having outfoxed the creditors and the jealous babes approaches a new attraction watching the incredible (and believe me it IS incredible) performance of the cancan Have you ever thought about being on the stage? he asks and the curtain descends Meanwhile poor Julian is sitting of the fire escape of the theatre listening to Peggy Sawyers new fans disparage his contribution to the shows success (I wont even go into 42nd Streets central line Oh Guy it was GRAND of you to COME!) br br Furthermore I wont go into the glimpse one gets of legendary Parisian entertainers including a brief vision of Piaf nor of the vision of a Paris both urban and rural Certainly there is a sample of the styles that engendered Trenet and Aznavour But it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity something unseen in any Hollywood musical with which it might be compared is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of 30s Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Astaire not to mention Dick Powell) let alone the barf promulgated by MGM in movies like the repulsive American in Paris All those fountains! Well save our comparison of that turkey to Breakfast at Tiffanys and its deconstruction of the American male for another daybr br That Danglard may have been a hopeful vision in postwar France of a kind of hyper-masculine mec that may or may not have ever existed is practically beside the point That he is a mans man neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton is perhaps more on target That he is a man who likes the ladies is never in question I for one wouldnt mind living his life at all I wonder if Gabin was that lucky br br At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called boloney I never got that far Bazs Moulin Rouge well Paris doesnt put that kind of stuff in the Seine anymore
There are frames in this film that could be Renoir paintings with vivid colors against muted backgrounds The humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence is refreshing in this fifties film and makes palatable the old story line of the ingenue that becomes a star The can-can number at the end seems realistic and exciting but not over the top as in an American dance sequence
Renoirs tale of Paristhe Cancana washer-girl and the Moulin RougeA more subduedbut highly entertaining version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge Jean Gabin gives his usual excellent performanceThe Technicolor photography on the print I saw was exquisiteAn easy evenings viewing chris w galla
Although it doesnt seem very promising for a long stretch Renoirs French Cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film The story is cliché: a laundry girl Nini (Françoise Arnoul) is discovered by a night club owner Danglard (Jean Gabin) Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers Nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too Im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have The film ends with the opening of Danglards new night club the Moulin Rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers The first of them Complainte de la Butte which also provides the base of most of the films musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and Renoir himself wrote it If youre a fan of Baz Luhrmanns 2001 film Moulin Rouge! youll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by Rufus Wainwright Although it isnt very prominent in that film everyone I know who owns the soundtrack loves it In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen Its hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl 810
French Cancan is one of my favorite all time movies Its an excellent film Theres color theres humor theres music Its a very good portrait of the so called Belle Époque though Jean Renoirs priorities were always to show a creation a fantasie So the film isnt a historical movie The final sequences in which the girls dance cancan are unforgettable images Its a film you shouldnt miss
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties Its the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway and the training of the dancers Finally the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are describedbr br Gabin is in great form as the easy-going Danglard--see him deal humorously with Ninis violent boyfriend Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini Maria Felix with that amazons body is imposing as the egotistical Lola Danglards first lover Finally Françoise Arnoul as Nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for Danglard and becoming his girl is just stunning; her loveliness and pert charm will win you overbr br A bonus: we get Edith Piaf Patachou André Claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the Moulin rouge
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical but in French way And a Jean Renoir nice tribute to his time his friends lovers music and dances It is at same time a show business chronicle of that age full of affection and French mood It is too a clear tribute to the Impressionism (people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture) It is particularly a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and of course to Jean Renoir father Pierre-Auguste You will find hear a trustworthy and splendid colored recreation of some Renoir master work Excellent casting scenery sound-effects and music Even it tell us about the creation of Parisian Moulin Rouge obviously it is a fiction story (and not very original by the way as it fall down in the very well know moral that the show must go on) But the Jean Renoir production is greatbr br 
Uncle Frank is everyones uncle This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America the lonliness the humor the irony Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were supremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience The director did an unbelieveable job of capturing the small and large pieces that made up their lives Thanks to everyone who helped in making this film!
This film works on a lot of different levels Its a profile of one very cool couple a social commentary on aging and nursing homes a love story a musical Ive seen Uncle Frank a few times and every time I watch it Im not sure who to go call first--my parents my wife a friend Ive lost touch with   But it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life--and want to reaffirm the ones that continue Expect a lot of laughs and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a chord Im pretty sure they will
It doesnt matter whether youve experienced the plight of the elderly in America or if youre just plain clueless Uncle Frank and Matthew Ginsburg give you that clue in a straight forward funny wake up and smell the roses sort of way By the end of the film it is obvious that while being totally entertained somehow youve also been educated A terrific film by a terrific up and coming talent in the movie field Matthew Ginsburg is a name to pay attention to
The silver screen gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying lifes rainbows Theres plenty of silver hair on this silver screen but the films namesake is more like 85-going on-25 with his energy humor and lust for life The story of entertainer extraordinaire Uncle Frank his devoted wife Aunt Tillie and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to live each day as if its your last and brings a glimmer of hope to those often-dreaded golden years A great movie for young and old audiences!
Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film The Journey starring Yul Brynner Deborah Kerr Robert Morley EG Marshall Anne Jackson and Jason Robardsbr br The film takes place during the 1956 Hungarian uprising and concerns a group of travelers having problems getting out of Budapest because of political problems in that part of the world They are put on a bus to Vienna but the Russians led by Major Surov (Brynner) confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards) posing as an American but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter whom the major believes is being smuggled out of Hungary In fact Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding him She becomes the focus of the Majors romantic attentionsbr br Very good film that conveys the tension and hassle of the Cold War and all of the performances are wonderful Brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate Major who isnt all bad and Anne Jackson gives a realistic powerful performance as a pregnant woman who doesnt want her child born in a Communist countrybr br Good script good director good cast - there should be more films like this Highly recommended
There have been many excellent comments about this movie and I want to add my voice to the praise Yul Brynner has never been more powerfully attractive His Major Surov was riveting Your eyes just cannot leave the screen when hes on it This is his movie This is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson As they were mostly stage actors they brought many nuances to their performances For example I have seen this movie at least 4 times but this is the first time I noticed the reaction of the German girl when she came face-to-face with a Russian soldier Even though he was not threatening her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in Germany after WWII and was most likely gang-raped by the Red Army The possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again Please put it on DVD
Most people will consider that Yul Brynners greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in from comic to tragic from eager to learn to dominating to hateful It also showed him to advantage as a talk singer and a dancer Finally as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as wellbr br But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I His comic turn in ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice So was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA or his Ramses in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS Yet he came terribly close to being a 1950s successor to Eric Von Stroheim as the man you love to hate A certain vulnerability in his acting and roles endeared him to the movie public even after his best years as a star were behind him - and he retreated more and more to repeating the King of Siam on television and the stagebr br To me his finest performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr Jason Robards Jr Robert Morley E G Marshall Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard The film is set in pretty modern times - the powder-keg that was Hungary in 1956 when briefly it looked like the Iron Curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad timing The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers) The West stood by and let this happen: England and France had gotten caught in the Suez crisis and the US had berated them and Israel for attacking Egypt Due to the actions of three close allies of the US the West found it hard to condemn the overkill of the Soviet Union It was an unfortunate situation and the Hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in itbr br In the film Brynner is Major Surov a Russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the Hungarian revolt one of whom is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards) Kedes may be getting assistance from some westerners on a bus tour through Hungary led by Robert Morley (including Marshall Jackson and Howard and Kerr) The latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired and Brynner mingles with them hoping for a lead to the whereabouts of Robards But Brynner is human - he tries to be ingratiating with these people (all of whom see him as a monster) and in sequence when he has drunk a little too much he confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945: How is it (even if one notes that Russia had Stalin in charge) that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? The allies on the whole had worked well together from 1941 to 1945 but after Yalta and Potsdam all types of mutual suspicions just erupted Did they have to? Surov is a good officer but he is torn in half by loyalty to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary that he supports and his growing fondness towards Kerr who is hiding Robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the Russian major And as the film reaches its tragic climax we watch as Surov has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty or take pity on Kerr Robards and the other westerners who want to leave It becomes a true struggle for him - and one that he may win far too late It was a great film about a tragedy of post war Europe and possibly the most thoughtful role Yul Brynner ever portrayed
Yul Brynner was a symbol of villein in the tine of 50s  he play a role of Russian leader in Hungary at the time of revolution in this country in 1956 that made it against the Marxismbr br The script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from Hungary to Englandbr br The best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the Hungarian Resistance to kill the Russian major(Yul Brynner) in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from his bad works  but at the end he made a good work to help Deborah Kerr for escaping her and her darling to London to write in his book a good working to gain at the end peoples agreement and trustment after his assassination by the Hungarian Resistance
The Journey is a very good film Produced in the spring of 1958 in Vienna and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in his early years Despite the political problems which influenced the movies success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution the Cold War) The Journey is a very good film but not well-known I think it should be released immediately on DVD because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner their intense relationship All their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore) Another quality is the script which is very well written It was even published as a novel by the screen player George Tabori The film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end At first we didnt know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary because the Communist Major discovers that Dianas friend Paul Kedes is Hungarian and he isnt allowed to leave the country The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is in fact the true reason why he doesnt want to let her go But after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses him too he lets her go And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed-the Major and Diana say Goodbye! she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers including Paul while Surov is shot several times by some Hungarians so he dies Yul Brynner is very very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful charming refined just like an English Lady Yul and Deborah are perfect together They are one of the greatest couples of the Golden Hollywood A true moviegoer should watch this film The Journey has everything that a good film should have-a great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is in my opinion at his best) Finally I want to give a message to Warner Bros Studios or those who restore and release classic films: Please release The Journey on DVD as soon as possible
As a big Dostoyevsky fan I had always been disappointed with Hollywoods halfhearted attempts to get into the Russian romantic aesthetic -- case in point Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov I had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind When given an intelligent script to work with he suddenly came alive and was as noble sexy and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri But thats because writer Tabori actually gave Yul as the Conflicted Russian Officer the kind of Conflicted Russian Officer lines that are worthy of real literature and that have real meaning and pathos in them For example a propos of folk music he says musingly You hear a man crying in the dark And if you listen carefully enough you know what he cries for You look surprised Lady Ashmore Despite what you may have heard tractors and Marxism arent the only things the Russian cares for There is always time for musicbr br Brilliant!!
a great movie with a rather unclear political message it´s shot in a theatrical style ic most of the action takes place inside mayor surov and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other emotions run high since the western tourists and business-people seem unwilling and unable to yield to the eastern-russian charm of the mayor although he makes every effort to understand their point of view the two opposite world-views are made pointedly clear but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics its powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie
I really enjoy this movie The first time it was on Turner Classic Movies All the actors did very well but Brynner steals the show again like always ( he is so sexy!)This is one of the movie that you do see Brynners emotions Actually this movie this is the first I ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong larger-than-life and serious roles in other movies In this movie you see both a masculine tough and sensitive side of Brynner Brynner seems to be a ladiesman in this movieThat is amazing how Brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian tongue it drives me crazy in love I dont understand when both Brynner and Kerr ( they both have very good chemistry) stars in a movie together and then Brynner always die at the end it kind of reminds you The King and I in a way
Yul Brynner is Major Surov a singing dancing vodka-drinking Russian Officer stationed near the Austrian -Hungarian border during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 in Anatole Litvaks The Journey Though the film has yet to be released on video or DVD it remains one of Brynners most compelling performances Because of the political unrest a group of travelers cannot fly out of Budapest but are put on a bus to Vienna Before they can reach the border however their passports are taken and they are detained for questioning by the Russians led by Major Surovbr br The Major has reason to suspect that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country Indeed Lady Ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger Paul Fleming (Jason Robards Jr) who pretends to be an American but fools no one She is helping Fleming mainly to repay a debt she owed because of the trouble her past association caused him Among the other passengers are a British journalist played by Robert Morley an American family played by EG Marshall his wife Anne Jackson and their two children one of which is the screen debut of little Ron Howardbr br Major Surov takes a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr) and a romance of sorts develops between them She offers him nothing but disdain and a stiff upper lip however though we suspect that underneath her heart still beats The Cold War intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing It remains however one of my favorite Yul Brynner films and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance
I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls smiles and laughs Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments Taras Bulba The Magnificent Seven The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shotbr br Equally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is Deborah Kerr The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive--she reprised this sort of role years later in The Night of Iguana The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the Russians in fact she is shown as running away from the Russian Major (in contrast to the Maupassant story or the Isak Denisen story) Yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the Kerr characterbr br Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress She puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character It is this contradiction that makes her roles in The journey Quo Vadis and The Night of Iguana memorablebr br Why is this an unusual film? It is not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people--Dr Zhivago was an exception Brynners Romance of a Horse Thief was again great cinema by Abraham Polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards Leftists in the post-McCarthy erabr br The film is also unusual in its casting--great French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee--rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr and British actor Robert Morley In many ways the film is international than American All four are great actors and add to the entertainmentbr br Those who have read Maupassant and Denisens works will find the film is not true to either work Yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized (censored?) version has a dignified charm of its own--provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group I think Litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales (eg the last bus ride and the final kiss)br br But I do have one grouse--why do Hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (eg Insomnia) have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria However three things complement the story making this an extremely good moviebr br First the actors use the actual languages of their roles The Russian soldiers speak only Russian; the Hungarians only Hungarian; the Germans only German except to the minimal extent to tell the story Since Debra Kerr is English she speaks only English and of course Yul Brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English As a result the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when heshe cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them Very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages the audience is never at a loss for following the film No subtitles are necessarybr br Second I was in Hungary in 1995 and Im telling you this movie has it right on From the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes the realism is incredible If I didnt eat in the actual restaurant in the movie I ate at its double I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village (Actually the film was shot in Austria)br br Third and most important this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified Of course Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship so the Acadamy wasnt going to give him another one but that is the quality of the film Dont miss this one
The Journey is a romantic version of the cold war Its about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards Jr) out of Hungary during the Hungary Revolt in 1956 Shes on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian borderbr br Of course the bus gets stopped by the Russians for a security check The Russian officer-in-charge (Yul Brynner) becomes attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr)and delays the trip Of course the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist posing as a British citizen but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the English woman to come to him Of course this all sounds absurd but it is a fun movie to watch Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr Brynner and Ms Kerr which seems inappropriate in the situation that they are in the movie becomes suspenseful and interesting The good acting overrides some of the silly dialogue Perhaps some people involved in the Hungarian Revolt would not appreciate this movie; they would consider it a piece of fluff br br This is my favorite Yul Brynner role He speaks with his own masculine voice and is very attractive especially when he becomes vulnerable This is Deborah Kerrs second time working with Yul Brynner since they made The King and I in 1956 They make a very attractive couple Too bad they never worked again This was the second sexy role Ms Kerr took since From Here to Eternity Despite the fact that Ms Kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the movie she was very beautiful and sensual br br The fine supporting cast was headed by Jason Robards Jr in his first film role Some of the international cast were recognizable like for instance Robert Morley from England However the rest of the actors I have never seen before or since were just great in the movie In the background it was fun to see Senta Berger as one of the maids speak a few lines of Hungarian A few years later in 1966 she was in a movie Cast a Giant Shadow with Yul Brynner as his leading lady She is still working today
Set in Hungary in November 1956 this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the Uprisingbr br Once the airport is closed the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria As would be obvious they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless Yul Brynner whose military power as a Red Army Major was marked with loneliness his internal struggle between right and wrong his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings He was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contactbr br Robert Morley plays the quintessential stiff upper-lipped Englishman who no matter how serious the role manages to maintain an almost light-hearted logical outlook on life while Jason Robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career Deborah Kerr as the leading lady exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her characterbr br The film deals with a very tempestuous time in European history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover Fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great one-liners and comedic instances that add to rather than detract from the movie The chemistry in the cat and mouse game between Kerr and Brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film togetherbr br All in all a thoroughly engrossing movie which I would definitely watch again 810
Very literate intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in the Hungary of 1956 by invading Russian Communist regime Kerr and Robards play lovers she a British baroness he a Hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his bit for his country Other New York theater stars of the period Anne Jackson & E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young sons including Ronny Howard in his screen debut Jacksons character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon-to-be communist country; she gives an impassioned plea in the third act of this film which presages the naturalistic acting styles weve come to know today from Redgrave Fonda & Streep Leading the pack of Soviet wolves is Yul Brynner magnificent as a commandant and at his sexiest since he played opposite Kerr in The King and I He is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely patrician & heroic Kerr This is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the Golden Era of American film Do not miss it
Good show really good acting and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting unpredictable way especially since essentially its two people in a room It doesnt race through like many modern films but doesnt drag either Bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the now of her character which is still involved and not going back on her career choices - so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep self-examination of her soulBrundage has the delicate balance of weight innocence meekness and class to pull off Buddy very well A bit grainy on the film quality but it fits the tone of the story Could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things but definitely worth watching
I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham AL which was actually a really fun festival and was blown away by it It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together Its an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality Story stems from real life occurrences ripped straight from the headlines Raw blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end The film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity Definitely not suitable for kids Too depressing for some peoples tastes Definitely worth checking out in my opinion though
Although it was dark depressing and at times hard to watch You Are Alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog It truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships In addition the soundtrack was amazing The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie br br Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever watched Her compelling and believable performance made the movie It made me wonder if she really IS a prostitute Who knows Anyway the movie was very worth seeing LOVE YOUR SISTER! yeah thats right
One of the BEST movies I have seen in a very long time Bechard has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappointbr br This movie has you guessing throughout and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen There are no bad guys or good guys Bechard makes sure of that The characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them you care about what they have been throughbr br Bechards use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of FAST FOOD MOVIES and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable - you love the feeling it gives youbr br I have heard it said too often that there are no NEW stories to tell Thank you Gorman Bechard for proving that falsebr br Run dont walk to see this movie
This really is a movie that you need to see twice When I first saw this film I was really drawn into the story While the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake wonderful allusion) and Daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world Through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels The soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly dark lo-fi and intriguing When you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending I have seen in a long time I hope to see this movie find a distributor for the DVD so that it will be more accessible Great movie you wont be disappointed
I had actually considered investing in this movie when Gorman was out drumming up funding I loved most of the script but did not like the ending Gorman insisted the ending was as it had to bebr br Seeing the completed movie I have to say I am amazed Reading the script I had not imagined the acting (and Gormans directing) would be as powerful and moving as it is here The two leads did an amazing job They were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing starsbr br Now for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please dont read further as you need to see the movie first (I actually wish I had never read the script just so I could have experienced the movie ending first hand) br br ----------------------------- SPOILER br br I have two main problems with the movie First off and Im sure I mentioned this when I read the script the wife should have died If she were dead the ending would be much more believable As it is we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him years ago If she left him and he is still in love after so long hed have to be seriously delusional But he doesnt come across that way in the script (There is also the problem of why he did not expend all this energy going after the wife he still loves)br br Plus if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe that they had a fulfilling reciprocating love and therefore believe that the guy is devastated enough for the ending to be reasonablebr br However I dont buy Daphne doing what she does in the ending Id need a heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore but believable due to Bohls performance) did what she did The character is simply not cold enough And if she did this out of some kind of love or something else then there is a whole piece of the moviestory missingbr br Much of this movie is reminiscent of Sex Lies and Video Tape I think it could have been as popular if Gorman had chosen to give the movie a more believable ending br br So watch the movie enjoy the performance And make up your own mind
I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere)br br A haunting intimate portrait of Loneliness and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darkerbr br The acting of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damagedbr br Reminded me in theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where Im Calling From)br br The Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itselfbr br Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise) and the best soundtrack Ive probably ever heardif that all make sensebr br The first 30 seconds pretty much tells you youre in for a twisted ride (I was surprised no one walked out right away during the Brooklyn premiere) But from there the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people Daphne and Buddybr br Theyre lonely mess-up and boy do they talk about sex Daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting some are quite funny (Mr Chang) some disturbing (the Harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be whats going on or what Daphne is really feeling) and because I have a friend who used to escort I might add most seem quite real br br You Are Alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant Okay maybe a couple minutes less of the talking and I dont know that wed have missed anything br br Then again I need to see it again knowing the endingbr br I like this moviebr br (The director asked people in the Brooklyn audience to write a review on IMDb because a lot of people read them Request granted)
This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness but it is a springboard for learning these people they re life styles and pasts which support thisbr br The two lead actors (Bohl Brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen %100 believable they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly into their world The actors seamless acting teamed with Bechards Beautiful realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finaleThis film is visual treat- soft increasing the intensity of The story The soundtrack serenades the viewer soothing yet drawing out the emotional content of the film I find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece intriguingintense
This was a fantastic movie about two people one a young teenage girl and the other a middle aged man who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved onesbr br Both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to The script although written by Gorman Bechard seems as though it was written from a womans point of view And at the same time men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the moviebr br The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless I would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one It is clear in this film that you are not alone
I am a film directors nightmare especially of the mega buck multiplex variety While not a student of the art I still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buying into the film makers vision if I can find it Thats why a gem such as You Are Alone is such an exhilarating find The intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful nuanced performances and director Gorman Bechard displays a deft hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged peoplebr br Spoiler belowbr br I bought the DVD version and have shared it with several people The reactions have been varied from disbelief in the ability of Daphne to complete the assignment for which Buddy has paid her to an inability to watch the whole film because it was just too real and emotionally devastating As a compulsively skeptical moviegoer I have to be either grabbed by the collars and hauled for the ride or sidled up to and seduced by the filmmaker This film took the later route for me and by the end I was so involved that I felt Daphnes horror and pain at her role in Buddys demise My reaction to this film reminded me of watching The Cook the Thief His Wife and Her Lover by Peter Greenaway many many years ago By the end I was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too Ive watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated I am familiar with other works he has been done including a couple of cheeky movies Galactic Gigolo and Attack of the Killer Bimbos and a mixed bag The Kiss which I recently learned was killed in the cradle by the producer and doesnt really represent the directors vision Too bad because I loved the prior two films and even found The Kiss interesting but wish The Kiss was available in a directors cut with all of the original vision and music in tact I look forward to future work by this interesting director and the leads Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage
You Are Alone is a beautiful almost delicate film smart directed crisply written with two complex and riveting performances and a twist of an ending that no one will see coming but will make you want to see the film a second time to go back and catch up on all the clues you misreadbr br The story about a highschool girl who drowns her depression and awkwardness by working a few hours a week as a $500 an hour schoolgirl escort and the depressed next-door neighbor who discovers her secret and hires her for an afternoon call in a downtown New Haven hotel features breathtaking performances from both Jessica Bohl as the girl and Richard Brundage as her neighborbr br Bohl as Daphne gives a breakthrough performance on par with Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary She so captures a teenagers angst of growing into her own skin and when she talks about always being in control you start to realize shes not in control at all but in danger of going over the deep end which I guess in a way she doesbr br Brundage as Buddy is depressed angry heartbroken a shell of a man But it isnt until the films startling conclusion that you grasp a full comprehension of his painbr br After a very brief opening segment which will hook most independent film lovers and have the religious right running towards the exits we are brought into the hotel room At first youre not sure about these people or the film-making style Shaky annoyinglike the characters Until you realize their back story told in short flashbacks Theyre confrontational at first for a reason and so is the camera But as they open up as the story settles down likewise so does the camera And I dont know 20 minutes in give or take you find yourself unable to take your eyes away from the screenbr br Having just seen the world premiere screening at the Brooklyn Film Fest -- where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the ending and not one person answered yes  I almost wish the film were already on video so I could watch it again Because thinking back now on some of the conversations in the film particularly a very candid dialog regarding fantasy and climax I really thought things were going in a very different direction But I realize now so much of their conversation meant something completely different than what I imagined I need to see it again!!! But as dark and sexual as much of the talk is blunt to say the least I found myself laughing more than I might have expected at some of its candor which definitely falls into the things we think but lack the nerve to say out loud category Its very blunt especially when you realize so much of it has a completely different meaning Some of it will make you uncomfortable especially if youre watching You Are Alone with a partner Youll definitely have something to talk about  perhaps argue about  afterwards Perhaps it should come with a warning: You SHOULD be alone when watching! The music is amazing I would have come home and purchased the soundtrack at my favorite online music store if I could have The film looks as good as anything shot on film After the screening director Gorman Bechard was asked what sort of process he used to get the digital footage to look so good His answer: none They couldnt afford itbr br I have to give Bechard credit I am a big fan of his two shorts The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror but even they could not have prepared me for the complexities and surprises of this filmbr br To everyone involved: bravo
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured andor as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between theyre pain Death is explored figuratively and literally It is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive too awake to reality It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-bys This film explores the aching pain in us all the frown beneath the cheery facade the ache below The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and matter of fact and then Bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all Bechard the writer is a expert observer of the human condition and because of his non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield our eyes from but yearn to see and understand He as director focuses on the nuances of the actors spirit that shines through the character theyre playing to the actors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation This is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and womans experience together I have encountered as of yet even though the two characters encounter is probably not the normal encounterbr br The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough It is each characters real voice sung through the beauty pain talent and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide itbr br I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr Bechards both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it
I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you You Are Alone is that movie (for me) The film is constantly in my head and in my heart I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again as if I am seeing it for the first timebr br There is nothing I did not like about the movie Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect Very emotionally stirring!!! It was compelling and rivetingbr br I adored Jessica Bohl and her performance was the greatest I have ever witnessed I admired Brittanys strength (what a strong woman)br br The tag line is When your darkest moments come to life We never know what we are capable of doing Everyone says oh I would never do that when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation We are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject The honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite partbr br Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art!!!!
The 1980s My Dinner with Andre with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit 2005s You Are Alone demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul br br The story revolves around three principal characters Theres Daphne a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life Then theres the prostitute or paid escort Britney as self-confident as Daphne is self-conscious What makes them interesting is that they share the same body if not the same personae Part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the early scenes where Daphne approaches a door of an aged hotel room She halts and is obviously torn by the decision of whether or not to knock on the door  but it is Britney that effortlessly glides into the room when the door is openedbr br On the other side of that door is Buddy a middle-aged nobody with few if any personal qualities that anyone would find attractive He goes so far as to be confrontational about Britneys chosen profession as soon as she enters the room However we soon learn that Buddy is Daphnes next-door neighbor and has watched through the years as she grew from little girl to womanhood This complicates things for the audience Is Buddy just being a concerned neighbor or does he want something else?br br If its sex that Buddy wants here it is Britney loves sex Her definitions may be Clintonesque but that doesnt lesson her enthusiasm She prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic wristbands that her clients are invited to chose from Each color band denotes a specific act that shell perform  but exactly which act isnt revealed until after the band is broken off her wrist and the choice is irrevocably made br br Britney is or believes that she is in control of every encounter Even when blindfolded and bound as she is by one of her regular clients she imagines her arms and body being stroked by multiple men but her legs and pubic area being caressed by a woman in blood red lingerie The films imagery just keeps comingbr br Buddys pathetic life is one of acceptance Hes lost his wife his dog even his fantasies of the pretty teenager next-door Its no coincidence that hes lured Daphne or Britney to this particular hotel room Theres a painting on the wall of a dinner plate with only a fish head left This is a perfect metaphor for Buddys life; all of the good parts are finished So its here where he brought his wife when they were still college students that he makes his stand  to regain some control of his own life to make his statementbr br The director of You Are Alone Gorman Bechard knows his craft The principal action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film assisted by a myriad of inter-cut scenes that add dimension to the characters their circumstances and conflictsbr br As the film progresses Britney asks Buddy if she should get undressed He says yes but she strips only to her underwear An actual prostitute would probably remove all of her clothes (one of the professions five gets) But it isnt Buddy thats being teased we are As the film concludes we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in play A tease doesnt work unless it actually delivers Britney does so does You Are Alone
The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there The screenplay is intense and does not wander The plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsdens Center for Cultural Arts After the film ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still bothered While we put an 18 and up age restriction on the film I would watch the film with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation
I caught this at the Chicago IndieFest and have to say YOU ARE ALONE is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think Not HA HA Wedding Crashers funny but sick twisted I cant believe she just said that but its so damn true funnybr br Jessica Bohl who deservedly won Best Actress is amazing to watch Theres never a moment when you think oh Im watching a movie and shes an actress Shes too damn real for wordsbr br In fact theres 2 scenes that Im still giggling over and I wont give them away but in one shes in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how awesome it is (I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing!!!) br br In another she talks about a teenagers definition of sex versus an adults and if it isnt the truest dialog Ive heard in a movie in a long time I dont know what is
Jessica Bohl plays Daphne the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school Daphnes neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage) a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan yet details of each characters history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks Their appointment climaxes with the storys concluding twistbr br Both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance Their on-screen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuinebr br The films dialogue is natural real to life The writer Gorman Bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate Daphne is intelligent yet clearly still an eighteen year old Buddy may be middle-aged but still not the hackneyed naïve type normally depicted in film Daphne and Buddys conversation primarily deals with their despair and frustration with life but is still comical at the right times Although the general mood is very relaxed the dialogue has its own vivacity forcing the audience to become empathetic toward the characters conditions and uncomfortable at their straightforward vulgaritiesbr br The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film Each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters Even existing independently from the film the compilation truly expresses You Are Alones central theme-- lonelinessbr br You Are Alone is a less conventional piece that deals with of notions typically not spoken Definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness
If youre tired by the same repetitive unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases youll enjoy You Are Alone It is thought provoking well shot and rivetingbr br Without revealing anything that you dont find out in the first few minutes of the movie this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor The vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to comebr br Through their discussion you explore two shifting views of prostitution depression loneliness Yet the movie is not depressing It talks about dark things without being depressingbr br As a viewer your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around but gently You come out of it with a lot to think about I like that in a movie
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado played to perfection with expert timing and panache dont watch this version If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle strutting around in 1930s english gentlemens private club society this is the one to watch Its a lot of fun and a good intro to Gilbert and Sullivan but after this rush out and rent the Canadian Stratford version Youll see the difference between good and great Nobody does G&S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group
There are times I am convinced that The Mikado is the best Sullivan & Gilbert opera ever but that is only so long as Im not listening to Iolanthe Be that as it may The Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the Savoy Operas (Yes I put the composer first Nobody says Hammerstein and Rodgers or Hart and Rodgers or Boito and Verdi or Whats-His-Face and Strauss You dont even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach Suppe or Balfe Gilbert was just the bigger name (and the bigger ego) at the time so they put his name first Its time that silly practice was put to restbr br Anyway The Mikado is a compleat S&G operetta It has some of Sullivans catchiest numbers combined with some of Gilberts cleverest lyrics It has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue Its got a wonderful degree of craziness And it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costumingbr br This particular production filmed in a live performance in 1990 turns its imagination toward striking simplicity Set in a British seaside resort toward the end of the Art Nouveau period it throws over the japonerie of the original entirely The result is costuming and setting in an eye-caressing medley of whites grey and blacks accented by occasional bits of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green) It takes some getting used to but its really spiffy Of course when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of Japan you would be right to exclaim Oh pooh Bah! (Did I just say that?) Its most gratifying that this fine production is now on DVD However one caveat: the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy The tendency to superimpose images is alas annoying Why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy-fartsy stuff of that sort? But its the performance that counts the most We may skip the overture since although one is performed Sullivan never wrote one (True it may be so he wrote none for any of the Savoys But the Mikado overture doesnt even date from Sullivans lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others) As for the rest of the operetta its first-rate and supremely funnybr br The Ko-Ko here is the estimable Eric Idle who does it credit There is a tradition of bringing a Big Name into the role The was a US TV production years ago in which Ko-Ko was played by Groucho Marx with mixed results Idles performance is delightfully quirky  he does Taken from a county jail assisted by a tennis racquet His Ive Got a Little List is done as a speech to a microphone -- of course it has the usual updated lyrics which are much funnier than the usual run of such things and his delivery is positively hysterical It goes on that way throughoutbr br In this operetta its important to have a good Katisha; its just no fun if youre not being bellowed at in style This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer in her way almost as Big a Name as Idle She bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto  wonderful especially for a soprano And her costume!!! (Not to mention her recital with Franz Liszt apparently accompanying) Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone I have trouble getting around is somewhat un-Nanki-Pooish chubby shortness -- but is voice is undeniably a solid rich addition to the vocal palette There is a nice touch during A Wandring Minstrel where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of his nancy on his knee -- bear in mind the Mikados decree about flirting Be that as it may Bottone is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesnt put the best face on Nanki-Poo his performance doesbr br Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly She and Bottone do lovely duets Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his persona as something a blageur and does it very well Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water  a role later done to death in American sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children -- that sort of thing) The Mikado (Richard Angas) is bloody marvelous with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyricsbr br I dont recommend you get this as your only Mikado Get a good traditional production as well so you can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging That being said Ill watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once On the whole this is a terrific offering a vocal and visual delight with delicious over-acting Its a DVD to treasure with dervish-like maids tap-dancing bellhops and all Watch for the bellhops with signs
I first saw this on Thames television and loved it I subsequently saw a dreadful write-up by someone who certainly hadnt watched or listened to it So I bought a copy and then I bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD The Australian version is great but this one is better! I might buy another
I really enjoy this particular production of The Mikado The producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences -- for instance As Some Day It May Happen (the little list song) is completely updated and a few lines are ad-libbed throughout the play Liberties were also taken with the setting The costumes are not Japanese but rather 1920s English (although some of the Tittipudlian girls wear 20s-inspired kimonos) This production is well-choreographed with some 1920s dance styles and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes (as well as ears) entertained during the songs If youre a Gilbert & Sullivan purist these changes may bother you but I think theyre fine -- and I love the costumes! br br Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely hilarious; all of her scenes make me laugh out loud (one of my favorite add-ons is when she first makes an entrance -- the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics so she screeches at the top of her voice STOP IT!!!) All of the other main characters do a fine job as well I particularly like Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush (that toupee!) and Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yumbr br You must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly There is no change of setting although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest If there is one draw-back to this production it is that the stage makeup wasnt modified for close-up shots with a camera Foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner lipstick and blush everywhere Ive seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays and its a little jarring at first However I hope youll get used to it and enjoy The Mikado for what its worth -- a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic!
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film The writing acting directing could not have been better This was a story that begged to be told and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so Stories like this one are not pleasant ones but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed A film that can do that is a rare a special thing Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film br br Thank you for telling this story!!!br br Ruby
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings Such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it And Eric is hotter than ever To often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people Hey we are just like everyone else And this movie showed just that We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice It is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that I cant wait till this comes out on DVD Thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday There are good and bad in EVERY race why make them all out to be bad? That goes for all races today John Harper was an educated man he graduated from high school he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation He was a kind and gentle soul he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right I wasnt very old when he left our house but I can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother couldnt be bothered He even taught grade 3 the year before he came to Winnipeg None of this is mentioned in the movie and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as Im concerned What happened to John is unforgivable not only in the native community but also in the white community Not everyone in Winnipeg think like the police do I knew the person inside and what he was like as a PERSON not an Indian!
The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief(the Indian) by an Winnipeg city officer(the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie The actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada a small scale Martin Luther King thing The misjustice of First Nations people is becoming a staple in the Canadian cinema diet What makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the familys reactions The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach(WINDTALKERS SKINWALKERS)have minor almost cameo appearances Soon-to-be star Eric Schweig makes his mark in this film with a powerful performance An honourable mention goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk who has chalked up over 100 movies to his credit His portrayal of the troubled soul Inspector Dowson was worthy of a Gemini Award(the Canadian Emmy)along with Eric Schweig The special effects(jump cuts dream sequences) are occasional and not overbearing Couple this with some beautiful northern Canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and First Nations people like the Neil Stonechild case and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience
Blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action I cant wait for Blade 2 This is one of Wesley Snipes greatest movies the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great
Okay sure this movie is a bit on the hokey side Its difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher anyone?) but this tries very hard Ive never read the actual comic book but that doesnt really matter I suppose I judge a film mainly on its merits not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone elses idea (Unless its a film based on a true story that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy) So why will I give this movie a fairly high rating? Because it tries It tries very hard In my book that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining filmbr br Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus It seems everybody has their take on vampire lore be it the cross the silver the garlic the aversion to sunlight whatever Some of those ideas are included here The storyline is familiar a group of vampires conspire to take over the world with one person (mainly) standing in their way Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses who have slowly but surely moved into the world and share it with humankind For the most part the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them The vampires have even taken familiars people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turnedbr br Now that I think of it there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film They Live A hidden enemy hidden group of people plotting against them the fight to save human-kind all that is present in Blade as wellbr br The acting isnt the best here Snipes is at best only slightly better than some of his other roles; NBushe Wright a relative newcomer isnt too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blades sidekick (hes to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher) Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here as the head vampire you just love to hatebr br I dont know but I just loved the special effects in this film From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film the special effects arent half bad Theres certainly enough blood and gore to go around but after all this is a vampire movie right? The various shapes and sorts of weaponry Blade uses are fairly unique and not generally used in contemporary action films Snipes has more flair with a decked-out sword than he does with say a machine gun Plus theres so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away (Unless of course you are Indiana Jones)br br Overall this isnt the best action film ever made but its not half bad either As a bonus the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool too Tell me in what other movies can you hear super drumnbass like Source Direct or Photek?!br br My Rating: 810
hibr br Blade is an sensational action movie  the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain have done justice to their rolesbr br The movies action sequences are better then Matrix! br br Wesley Snipes is one the best action heroes everbr br If u like actionvampire movies  this is the ONEbr br the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made beforeBut these is the best of thembr br Enjoy the Ride
Its got action and fantasy mixed all together what more do you want in an action movie? And it also has one of the best martial artists in the movie industry today Wesley snipesSo all in all this movie hasnt left anything out And thats my comment of what I think is a classic beat em up movie
Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics present a plot and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel And thats exactly what this movie happens to deliverbr br However unlike with most other comic book movies I felt that this one did it with a bit of class Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes Blade presents a very modern believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (ie sappy) aspect is concernedbr br Yes the movie has innumerable plotholes and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this what else matters? It may run a little long but for what it sets out to do Blade stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre
In this film I prefer Deacon Frost Hes so sexy! I love his glacial eyes! I like Stephen Dorff and the vampires so I went to see it I hope to see a gothic film with him Blade it was very about the future If vampires had been real I would be turned by Frost!
Blade is probably one of the best vampireaction movies ever madeIt has it all:actionhorrorbloodthis movie is for action fansIts either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it it means you dont like action or vampires moviesWesley snipes takes his role seriously and he his the perfect guy for blade
Great underrated movie great action good actors and a wonderful story line Wesley is verry good and the villain the bad guy is wonderful The girl plays a nice role and the comedy mixed with blakness!
I loved it In fact I watched it over and over and over and I could watch it again This movie doesnt get boringbr br The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie Its a job well done great for todays generationbr br Wesley Snipes was born for this role Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire Arly Jover mmmm mmm she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has Donal Logue provides great comical reliefbr br This vampire movie is like no other I cant wait for Blade 2
this film was brilliant! i absolutely loved it! wesley snipes was great for this role - and im sure blade 2 would be just as goodbr br blade is by far one of my favorite actionhorror movies out there! and if you havent seen it yet and like vampires and blood (all that stuff) you should really rent it because i assure you that youll love it!
I remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that I vowed to buy the video when it came out br br While I wont go too far into dissecting this film I will say that I gave it an 810 for all the reasons you can read in the other users reviewsbr br What I will say is this: br br The first 10 minutes of this film are incredible Its as close to a textbook audience grabber as Ive ever seen I once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutesbr br Everyone who watched the opening stayed to the end
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever I liked this one even more than X-men In fact this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade He is just not an emotionless super hero Also this movie isnt sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating Sure comic books are for kids mainly but I like a little more in my movies Lets face it if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic This comic book adaptation also has something that many dont A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy Lets face it none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight
This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud The movie is a fast paced thrill ride of action and superb stunts The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too Wesley should have done more action films than he has i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all only Bruce Willis Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close Also aswell as Wesley being quality Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing but he does Overall the film is sharp stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace
Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn - fast loud and moody Despite my initial fears Kris K carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence Lots of blood steel silver burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction IF you like the black look of The Matrix then Blade will appeal to you Blade even has a dodge the bullets sequence
For a brief moment The opening scene with Traci Lords and thebr br techno bar is incredible Id probably follow her to my ultimate death too! Best vampire movie of all time but with a twist The fight scenes are awesome Wesley Snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary Great flick 910 Wheres Blade II?
However closely the movie is to the comics it doesnt matter This movie radically moves away from the boredom of Interview with the Vampire (although its acting was good) and slides in the wonderful action scenes Very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all Disadvantage - poor graphics Does it matter? Nope
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations Blade is by far one of the best realised and most faithful (overall) to the source material given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvels Tomb of Dracula the writer took almost ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comics history While changes were inevitably made the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms Dont let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one fine film If it feels too comic booky for you Stanley Kubrick snobs out there its because its supposed to Deal with it but dont dis it for it
Blade is a dark gloomy but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones A bit of gore but nothing really that bad Wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires Not really like buffy because thats too tame but Blade delivers a decent plot and its the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy nightthats at best viewing!br br 87%
Overall I give this film a decent 76 To start Ill say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras youll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film Among the changes Blade is now most importantly half vampire therefore acquiring all of their strengths but none of their weaknesses The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really Wesley Snipes is born to play this role although some wouldve probably pererred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol) His acting here doesnt need to be exactly Oscar winning per say considering the character but Im glad he decids to play the DayWalker in the two sequels Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blades Alfred so to speak The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts Ive got to say As much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like Spider-Man or X-Men Stephen Norrington had the villains portrayed in a way I didnt like so much honestly Their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didnt really feel like a comic book film to me Plus La Magra a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it I guess Not to mention a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beaing the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kindawelldumb Moving away from a few of its flaws the music by Mark Isham was great and fitted the film nicely Luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel Blade 2
Blade would be an extremely above-average comic-book vampire-hunter actionhorror if it werent for two minor flaws #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible BladeSnipes do his slicing and dicing but the whole Yes! fistpunch was literally a letdown #2 Bad no make that horrible CGI  even for 1998 standards This is mainly in the last third but some sprinkled throughout Okay despite those minor infractions I really enjoyed this movie All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another Matrix rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior So maybe The Matrix copied Blade At any rate its a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks action fanatics and horrorvampire lovers So we have Blade half-manhalf-vampire or day-walker and his accomplish Whisler (a la Batman and Alfred) battling the undead who apparently almost out number humans Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blades more of an antihero) our sword ninjavamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialistdoctor Meanwhile trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it Its not the most original concept if you read what I just wrote but still highly enjoyable You will want to see Blade succeed you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms And you will know whats coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie Still watch this without trying to go too deep Such as Vampire SPF-1000 suntan lotion? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldnt that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh okay I am going too deep Once again sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride
Hope the summary line wont irritate you that much (its a little homage to the Chappelle ShowCharlie Murphy but also to the character Daywalker) But Ill try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didnt like in another paragraph so it will be easier to read! br br Lets start with the good things! The quote strong bloody violence (which is used by rating boards to describe the content of a movie does fit here very well This is not a movie for kids! Or for the faint of hearted! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to holdjustify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent The action scenes are great here toobr br OK over to the things I didnt like The overall story is too thin Its enough as Ive written above to hold the action scenes together but there could be more And a character like Blade deserves more (imo) The drama therefor isnt the best  also its use of clichés doesnt help Some characters are underwritten  Thats that! :o)
I admit I go more for the traditional vampire tale but this one is a real winner Lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours There was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world A good one for all us vampire lovers
It seems to me that a lot of people dont know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men Daredevil Punisher and the likes What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe At least until he was reinventedbr br David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight He cant take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character He is however a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels) Kris Kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing NBushe Wright however is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character German Udo Kier should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race probably born of his experiences from playing Dracula Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I have perhaps ever seenbr br The story is good and I feel renews the vampire genre (something that hasnt been done since Robert Rodrigues From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic Far from it A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible Including the effects which are pretty good for their time I found the vampire dustings to be a very nice touch In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great The fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its facebr br As previously stated Norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following Blade movies Del Toro is nearly as skilled but I prefer Norringtons style His style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere A very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story Along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the moviebr br All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie suffice to say many of them are located near the ending of the film) does that the film must settle with a high 7br br 710
Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade a half human half vampire known the daywalker He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the worldbr br This movie is well cast written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish Packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue Blade is certainly more action than horror but it definitely deliversbr br 810
If you like horror or action watch this film ASAP If the opening scene doesnt get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse Great Action excellent casting and top one-liners This is the only film I have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop kick & punch thrown Not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun Its a pure rush of dark comic book action 910
Blade is a fantastic actionthriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yetbr br This film has everything that you would ask for in an actionthriller it has plenty of blood guts and gore a twisted disturbed bad buy moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twistsbr br Their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects Wesley Snipes fighting movement is fantasticbr br This film is in my opinion a must see Wesley Snipes cool solid appearance makes this film and I cant wait for the sequel BLADE 2 being released next yearbr br My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10
Now here is a movie that does something that hasnt been done in a long time It take ten or so different elements that were already familiar with (Vampires martial arts a techno beat top-o-the-line special effects etc) and turns it into something that feels brand new In what could have easily been merely a combination of Mortal Kombat and Buffy: The Vampire Slayer Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of Passenger 57) gives a really good turn as the half human half bloodsucker He acknowledges the internal conflict but doesnt dwell on it more than necessary He makes Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton made Batmanbr br Ill say that the only part of the movie that got me a little miffed was the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happens to know who happens to know exactly how to stop the evil guy On the other hand you sort of have to have that in a movie like this so its easily excusablebr br Well Snipes is good And Steven Dorff hyped in the previews makes a more than bad enough bad guy to Snipes hero Hes got class presence and enough control in his little pinky to teach Al Pacino how to tone it down a bit Who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launching pad for an actor? I sincerely hope this is And whoa! where the heck did Kris Kristofferson get acting talent? Dont get me wrong but the prolific actor hasnt done anything memorable since Millennium and how many of us watched that just cause of the cool video box? Well here he is folks in a very Obi-wanish turn as Blades mentor and father figure And good job toobr br The quality of the acting is matched by the quality of the choreography and special effects Accompanied by a pulsing techno beat the fight scenes brings back and quickly banish memories of Mortal Kombat Hey! It had a script too! I was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out therebr br The two major indications to me that I saw a quality flick were these; I had no feeling of remorse about paying full price to get in a la any Schumacher Batman The Avengers MK: Annihilation Godzilla or Armageddon (wow how many of those came out this year? Ugh) Also I look forward to the inevitable sequel as per the films ending Lets just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first onebr br 
I didnt see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks Ever since the Batman series Spawn Judge Dredd and many other pitiful pg-13 bombs I dodged everything at all cost I would question in my mind why cant someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story how difficult is that? And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence blood martial arts weapons fire the good against evil etc Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies and most of them have bombed But not Blade the movie was filmed just right not going overboard delivering a good length and never a dull moment Blade II is cool but not as cool as the first Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks Ive seen in a long time
I must confess that Ive been a huge fan of the almighty David the Hoff Hasselhoff ever since he starred in the hit 80s TV series Knight Rider Whether its his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy Revenge of the Cheerleaders or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the schlocky sci-fi gem Starcrash the Hoff has proved time and time again that hes a simply terrific (and shamefully underrated) actor supreme The Hoff excels here as Gary a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with his repressed virginal writer girlfriend Leslie (attractive brunette Leslie Cummings) investigates a seedy dilapidated haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of Massachussetts Theyre doing research on witchcraft throughout the ages and the hotels last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts A bickering family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel Pretty soon various folks begin to get bumped off in assorted gruesome ways by the mysterious Lady in Black (an effectively eerie Hildegard Knef)br br Granted the rest of the cast gives the Hoff a run for his money: the ever-perky Linda Blair projects her customary charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who winds up becoming possessed (natch!) legendary jazz singer Annie Ross bitches it up with gleeful aplomb as a snippy old bat (poor Annie winds up being incinerated alive after she has her lips sewn shut and shes hung upside down in a chimney) and gorgeous blonde Catherine Hickland oozes considerable sex appeal from every fetching pore as a lusty slut Fabrizio Laurentis competent direction a suitably creepy atmosphere Gianlorenzo Battaglias slick glossy cinematography (the fluid prowling Steadicam tracking shots are especially nice) the gaudy special effects Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Millers spirited shudderynspooky score and the gory sadistic violence are all up to par But ultimately its the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the Hoff which makes this choice tasty chunk of tacky Italian horror cheese such a winner: He takes his shirt off once (hubba hubba!) gets sprayed with blood and -- WARNING: Major SPOILER ahead -- even meets a pleasingly grisly untimely end Produced by none other than Joe DAmato this picture overall rates as good sleazy fun

Witchery is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly hes one of the better actors Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoffs wifeshe is hilariously bad! The plot of this film is ridiculous too Its got some holes which you cant help but notice but it remains entertaining throughoutbr br The gore in Witchery is freaking outstanding I loved the part where the old bag gets sucked into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast! And the part where the lady gets taken advantage of by the Devil was pretty damned disturbing Id say this one is a must for gorehoundsbr br If youre looking for an overproduced well-acted flick look elsewhere But if you like old-school style Italian sleaze and over the top gore Witchery belongs on your shelfbr br Im surprised by the low rating on here! What were you people expecting The Exorcist? 7 out of 10 kids
Linda Blair has been acting for forty years now and while she will never escape the part of Regan MacNeil in The Exorcist few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as Witchery does She plays Jane Brooks a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch (Hildegard Knef) It seems that a long-ago witch-hunt resulted in her suicide and she was with child at the time Unaware of the danger Jane has recently dreamt of the witchs dramatic death and Janes little brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) has been more directly visited by her spooky black-clad spirit which he calls the lady in black The groups time at the island inn begins quietly enough; unknown to them however the Lady in Black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat (George Stevens) Before long the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the Lady in Black begins her reign of terror She plans to avenge her own fate by possessing Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child Each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse - greed lust and the blood of a virgin As the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild she haunts them one by one in gruesome horrifying ways The island location is effectively scary and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot Its such a colorful film that it reminds me of Dario Argentos work The lighting is excellent and the set decoration is perfectly spooky The soundtrack is very effective and unique The horror effects are extreme terrifying and unforgettable The cinematography is great and it is this that brings us back to Linda Blair The creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot: lots of dramatic push-ins lingering close-ups that subtly detail Janes incremental possession and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films There are hidden homages to Rosemarys Baby Jacobs Ladder The Shining Black Sunday and of course The Exorcist She does a great job and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance That isnt to say that the rest of the cast disappoints; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good and veteran performer Annie Ross is memorable as Janes bitchy mother Rose Hasselhoff gives it his best but he is not essentially a film star and his television persona gets in the way of his performance Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together The film is otherwise so violent and creepy (in a good way) that it desperately needs their warmth (Blair also played a mother in 2003s Monster Makers and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them) Lastly Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch and she has the most amazing voice and accent Along with Blair she was also perfectly cast But its Blairs movie all the way Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability and this aspect of the film hearkens back to Exorcist II: The Heretic I think Witchery is up there with The Exorcist Exorcist II Hell Night and Summer of Fear as Blairs best genre work to date
Witchery or Witchcraft as its commonly known in Europe beings with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) waking up from a nightmare involving a witch Janes Mother & Father Rose (Annie Ross) & Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from Boston renovating it & reopening it Together with Jane & their young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) Rose & Freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to check on the amount of work that needs doing they also meet up with the estate agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) & hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island Once there they enter the hotel & begin to inspect the property while back on the boat Sam is killed & the boat is let loose to sail off into the distance They discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) & his virgin fiancé Leslie (Leslie Cumming) who happens to be researching a book that she is writing about the gruesome legends & superstitions surrounding the infamous island & hotel As the night draws on a raging storm outside isolates them from the mainland as a mysterious lady in black (Hildegard Knef) keeps popping up as the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks fresh victims for demonic possession human sacrifice & Satanic ritesbr br The director of this American Italian co-produced film is somewhat shrouded in mystery as the IMDb lists Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin but there are rumours that Joe DAmato did the honours either way to be honest despite its bad reputation I found Witchery quite entertaining in a so-bad-its-good cheesy sort of way The script credited to Harry Spalding & Daniele Stroppa on the IMDb again is confusing too as the actual credit on the film itself is Daniel Davis anyway whoever wrote this thing did a decent job please stop laughing At heart its a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths & a surreal feeling to everything The different sets of characters have reasonable motives & didnt get on my nerves as much as Id thought they might its not plotted very well it doesnt make a whole a lot of sense & the dialogue isnt exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole Witchery entertained me for its 95 odd minute duration plain & simple Its reasonably well paced a little slow to get going maybe but there are plenty of surreal bizarre goings-on & gruesome deaths to keep one amused One part of Witchery which destroys some of its credibility is this so-called storm there is no storm in sight & the sea is probably calm enough to swim in Witcherys supposed twist ending didnt really work for me either & just check out the dumb expression on Cummings face on that final freeze-frame The hotel provides for a good isolated location & adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive indefinable horror feel throughout cheap horror at that Technically Witchery is not too bad at all it was obviously shot on location so it looks good throughout & while not exactly the pinnacle of film-making finesse its overall production values are slightly better than expected The violence & gore is of typical Euro explicitness a woman has her lips sewn shut & hung inside a fireplace so she cant scream as the others light it someone is crucified & then burned alive impaled on a swordfish someones veins expand & pop & a woman is raped by a man with no lips Witchery was shot in English so there is no dubbing as far as acting goes David Hasselhoff & Linda Blair in the same film what more can I say?! Yes ladies Hasselhoff does take his shirt off & for the lads Cummings takes hers off Both Hasselhoff & Blair are a hoot to watch in this thing however the little kid is very annoying & really cant act at all I sure most sane film-goers will disagree with my opinions but I still stand by the fact that I liked it & would happily watch it again Witchery is pretty good fun & definitely worth a watch if your into bad films or your a horror fan in general
I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual horror movie again I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the Exorcist movies (Which i loved) What was up with all of those nasty B-movies she did? br br David Hassellhoff on the other hand all i could do is laugh He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor David needs to stick to Knight Rider or Baywatchbr br All around this is an awesome movie Even for the eighties this was an awesome film It has horror action and drama It is a suspenseful and I loved the way Linda Blair turned out
During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it Something like: Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism?br br So my comprehension of this movie was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism When recently seeing this movie in the TV-version I had this filter before me and it wasnt difficult to see thisbr br Strangely enough I havent met this way of interpreting the film ever since I first heard itbr br These are the things I found in Four shades of brown In all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster:br br 1 The crematory-worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them In the crematory-room in dealing with death and fire its almost like a cheerful game to him The seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy accordingly in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures his father severelybr br Possible lesson: The importance of showing the young adequate emotions When they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to goodbr br 2The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer Just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand reaching for personality integrity and joy he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despairbr br Their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to his parents bad taste The real problem he is carrying within is far from comprehensible to him: His fathers behavior passes on when suffocating his own wife in his spotless environmentbr br Possible lesson: Oppression breeds bondagebr br 3The father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to his children when he cheats them on their inheritance He robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritancebr br Possible lesson: When no love given you cannot give anybr br 4The fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression Here the ice cold Nazi-sadism becomes very obvious in physical violence It gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young scin-head-nazists behavior when oppressing others br br Possible lesson? : Can Nazism take birth in a pervert home?br br Can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life in the long run be that room is given to sadistic Nazism ?br br Very seldom does a movie contains so much It reveals little by little as I meditate on it I consider it brilliantly painted and the actors are superb Especially the nice-seeming bloke played by Ulf Brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all
This movie must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four odd story about love or career I would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended br br Also the unique pause in the middle is something Ive never seen beforebr br Cant wait for the series (if theyre doing one) or the extended DVD Apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 35 hours
I didnt know what to expect from this hugely popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy & satire team as they released their first feature film More broad satire? Well we do get four contemporary exceptionally memorable tales of family pains generation gaps and fatherhood in particular But its drama thankfully and what drama! Epic in its scope as each episode is from carefully picked geographically different parts of Sweden But each story could seriously carry a whole movie if expanded separatelybr br Its dark twisted harrowing yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed Script acting and cinematography are absolute world class as three hours seem to get by in a blink! Its four shades of mastery and easily one of the best films in the nations cinema history Its Swedens answer to Short cuts or Magnolia if you like and instantly on par with those!br br 9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
Never ever have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people that faces a crisis or many In some ways a little like Short Cuts but totally different at the same timebr br There are a heap of lead characters whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold and they are as persons show their good and their bad sides their weaknesses and their strengths with lots of drama and laughterbr br The closest equivalent in a US movie I can think of which then is far weaker in every respect is the Royal Tenenbaums br br Four Shades of Brown as the title would be in English tells the story about a stressed out hotelier and his wife and his elderly parents (who are traveling magicians); about the receptionist at an animal crematory and his family misadventures; about the members of a cooking course (who mostly talk about their sorry lives) and fourthly about the funeral for a womanizing trotter jockey who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond the grave by singing and appearing in 3D during the funeral thanks to high tech equipment that has cost his entire fortune (the family gets nil not even the famous horse is given to the family)!br br There is a warmth and compassion in this film that is filled with grief and laughter that Ive never experienced beforebr br Most actors were new to me except Robert Gustafsson and one or two more but they all deserve the big slam the film took at the Swedish Guldbagge extravaganza (= the Swedish Oscar Awards) a week ago!br br Male female and male supporting actor prizes went to this film plus a few more to boot!br br If you have the chance go and see it - the hours float by very quickly!
This movie is about London and its an amazing movie it will be released on DVD in april 2003 and I will buy it when it gets out so If you have not seen it until then BUY IT The music in the movie is even better (saint etienne) have done the soundtrack
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London I was very excited to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival This movie has great shots an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a not so well known Londonbr br The movie is held completely in dark colours which I personally dont like too much Furthermore the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes got a little flat Other than that there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots FINISTERRE doesnt glorify London by showing all the great attractions of the city but rather gives deep insights in what London is really like From the East end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the special little retreats for Londonersbr br All in all:br br +Great Soundtrack +Nice shots +great insightsbr br -Narration -Tiering to watch at times -Very dark picturebr br Worth watching! I give it a 710
I absolutely LOVED this movie! Since I dont want to give much away its basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together Its very heartwarming story between the struggles they have I also think Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the entire film! This is definitely worth seeing! Two thumbs up way up!
I just saw this movie tonight Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman alot and Susan Sarandon is a great actor too but it was way better than I could have imagined You come out of the movie feeling great The acting was excellent which is something that can be hard to come by lately Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor Anyways back on subject the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and I definitely think that everyone should go see it I would give more details but I dont want to give away the movie
I just came back from seeing this awesome movie!! I can relate to it so muchIt reminded me when my sister had to go to college we had to move from place to place and my mom acts like Adele August! Boys might not like this movie since it brings tears to your eyes One of the best real-life movies Ive ever seen!! and Natalie Portman rules!! 1010
Im sorry but Star Wars Episode 1 did not do any justice to Natalie Portmans talent (and undeniable cuteness) She was entirely underused as Queen Amidala and when she was used her makeup was frighteningly terrible For Anywhere But Here she sheds her god-awful makeup and she acts normally And not only can she act good she looks good doing it Im a bit older than she (shes only 18) and I have little or no chance of meeting her but hey a guy is allowed to dream right?br br Even though Susan Sarandon does take a good turn in this movie the film belongs entirely to Portman Ive been a watcher of Portmans since Beautiful Girls (where she was younger but just as cute) Theres big things for her in the future - I can see it
Adam Sandlers movies are my favorite comedies The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie The Matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie Anywhere But Here is my favorite dramabr br Perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is its actingbr br Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing By the end of this movie I felt as if I knew her character better than I knew myself She did a simply amazing jobbr br Natalie Portman also did a great job I recently rented her first movie Leon (1994) in which she played a 12 year old girl I believe that she is a contradiction in terms; she was a good kid actress Well 5 years later she is still just as good an actress In fact shes much betterbr br Not only did Sarandon and Portman portray their characters well but they also worked perfectly together I mean even now I can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this moviebr br This movie is about a 14 year old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) that leave their home town in Wisconsin for Beverly Hillsbr br At first Portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years (usually down might I add)br br Although this explanation is a little vague the plot can only be summarized vaguely But when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak for it is actually very deep What I am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly but then they focus in on it to make it strongbr br And it is very strong but also the plot sequencing is great And there are a few brilliant scenes that I hope will someday be seen as classicbr br I loved this movie I laughed I cried And although admittedly there are a few loopholes its still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end
Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly!! I related to the character Ann August more than most would My Mother isnt AS eccentric as Adele but the feelings of lonliness is the same This movie is perfect in the ating aspects and Natalies and Susans performances are so linked together that its the best onscreen dual i have seen in years Their chemistry brings the characters to life they become real people! I would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away Because there is genually alot of people out there who would wish to be Anywhere But Here including me! and if you can see this movie with your best friend or your mother Its the tears that blend everyone around you together more!!
Its the best movie I have seen in 2000 it has the beautiful and talented Natalie Portman in it It has a great storyline cast and soundtrack I enjoyed it very much 10 out of 10
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman I had to see the movie I enjoyed every minute of it It plays out in a very sincere way Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother Susans character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of itbr br I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some-guy (hes in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed And I think that is great I think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the filmbr br Natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because I havent seen her in a bad film yet So any movie that has Natalie Portman will no doubt be seen by mebr br A good film 710
Most families will recognise similarities between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon Natalie creates an on screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and one worthy of a Golden Globe Nomination The control of her emotions are so in tact that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene Susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different to any other and carries it through with true professionalismbr br Any Natalie fan wouldve seen the film based on her past successes but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film It is a truly humbling experience
Susan Sarandon She made this movie for me Ive never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie She really acted as though she were Adele August I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character whos truly believable br br Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheralbr br I gave this movie an eight rating but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance As far as relationship movies go Beaches and Terms of Endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie but I highly recommend it
it´s a movie to see on tv and only once i mean it´s good but it´s a little too lengthy and the plot is so well-known it isn´t very original but it isn´t boring the best thing of the movie are the performances natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a great job i give it a 7
I was laying in bed flicking through the channels and boy do I have channels 500 of them With over 70 movie channels I probably watch a movie on cable once or twice a month DVD has spolied mebr br Anyway Im flicking through and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman I take interest 110 minutes later I am still interested How could this be? When I first saw the previews to this movie in the theater I remember making fun of it I never thought Id watch it nevermind like itbr br The story is based on a book and you can tell The movie is very episodic andits not like the movie has a great plot it just sucks you in May-be its that performances that do it Im pretty sure in must have beenbr br This movie was good for no reasonbr br Peters Movie Rating (out of 10): 7
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script Susan Sarandon plays the part of a flighty irrational and possessive mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood The daughter is dubious but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strongbr br In time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground She sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome seductive guy who loves em and leaves em She sees that the mother doesnt get it So how can she look to her mother for guidance?br br The mother directs the girl to a drama try-out and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly-by-night mother This causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic but the lesson takes holdbr br There is character-growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is persuaded to let the girl go It is a touching scene and a valuable lesson that parents however emotionally dependent have to let the child go and become her own separate person
Anywhere But Here is not exactly anything new but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills California in search of a better life The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie would much rather have stayed in Wisconsin with all of her friends and family and she felt that she was forced to go to California with her overbearing mother br br (spoilers) While its true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new Anywhere But Here doesnt cover any new ground but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again Also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years seen on Natalie Portmans face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about Natalies mother pressing her to become an actress as well as a very convincing performance from Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalies very close cousins from back home His death is a tragic cliché almost always seen in movies like this one but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this Not great but Anywhere But Here is definitely worth a look
Chick Flick? Of course Been done before? Many times Predictable? Yes Worth watching? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portmans portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line I am a great fan of motherdaughter stories What makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones ARE the performances and the character development Although this is not the BEST of its genre I will buy it and watch it again I felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top dramas brought upon us by Hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failed(especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of Natalie Portman) this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both Susan and Natalie share They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities I feel that these two actress talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar (full of cliches) and really saved the suffering plot I would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such over-the-top dramas
I thought Anywhere But Here was a good movieIt stars two wonderful actresses Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman which when I heard they were in a movie together I resist watching itOverall it was a pretty enjoyable movieIt had its moments where I felt as if they tried to hard and there was also some really overdone and worn-out material but there wasnt anything in the movie that I absolutely hatedI even liked how they used the pop-up performance of the uncredited Thora Birch and all the little happysad moments are touching and effectiveIf you want to watch this movie go ahead because even though I dont recommend it its not something you should avoid and a 59 rating seems unfair in my opinion
This film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoilsbr br Anywhere But Here is an engaging film from beginning to the end Both Ann and Adele are described well right at the start so we get to know how different their personalities are Clashes inevitably ensue and they are engagingly presented I find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances it is as if I am living their lives feeling what they are feelingbr br Susan Sarandon gives another excellent performance in Anywhere But Here She is charismatic happy go lucky hedonistic warm and loving all at once I have always liked Susan Sarandon and I think she is grossly underratedbr br Anywhere But Here is a captivating emotional journey
The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman She gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth Susan Sarandon a fine actress is suitably sincere as the mother figure I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script I am not saying the script was bad in any way I am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times I dont think it was the script writers fault The film did suffer from being overlong and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes The film does look beautiful with some good direction and excellent performances All in all watchable certainly but maybe more for an older audience 710 Bethany Cox
Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother Adele (Susane Sarandon) Thats how the movie begins Adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter Its really deep and touching thanks to the great work of the actresses Natalie was nominated to a Golden Globe for that role She is one of the most talented actresses I ever saw and so is Sarandon They really look like mother daughter The soundtrack is also great The movie is incredible 10 out of 10
I was able to see Anywhere But Here last night as a free sneak preview I absolutely LOVED the film! I was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a motherdaughter relationshipthere was definitely a connection between Adele a and Ann I think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman Sarandon was just the right actress to portray Adele and after leaving the theater I could not think of another actress in the role Portman was also excellent as Ann She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I dont think any other teenage actress could I think it would the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both Sarandon and Portman for Awards in the Actress and Supporting Actress categories It would be a shame if they were overlooked
My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film but this is not true I did enjoy the movie but was probably expecting too muchbr br Adele who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon did not come off as a very likable character She is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail Adeles daughter Anna is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mothers shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old This of course makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna since she never seems to be 14- 17 years old either Portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years Yet even with the two solid leads Wayne Wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more so with Smoke Though I have not read the book the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story I enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work but I never got lost in the experience and I never related to their plight
Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter Sarandon has this ability call it talent if you will to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes As the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl Sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer More importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over Portmans portrayal of the daughter The question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot who changes? This film is certainly about the daughter but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that Mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter I am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also The hallmark of fine drama
Being a freshman in college this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom Of course my situation doesnt parrallel with Natalie Portman and Surandons situation; but my mom and I have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights There is always the mother telling you what to do or not being the kind of mother you want to be I was balling my eyes at the end of this movie Surandons reaction of her daughter going to the East coast miles away after all theyve been through reminded me of how I felt being from a small city in the West coast going to New York br br The movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up It is very touching I was moved by the movie Every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real you didnt get any phony sentimentality I was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie alone wishing my mother was sitting next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything This movie is a bit corny of course but everything is trully momentous Its all about what a mom can learn from her child; and what a child learns from her mother 810
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship It is a family story that isnt dulled down by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is I couldnt help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends The acting was quite exquisite and I hope well be seeing both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles down the road
Well I have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film Natalie Portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother-daughter relationship film br br Beautiful film
This film was a new direction for Natalie Portman A much more adult role though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself Ann(Portman) and Susan Sarandon who plays her newly divorced mother Adele travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to Beverly Hills There these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as Portmans character grows up Unknowingly at first to Adele she grows up and becomes a better mother for itbr br Ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress or so she thinks Adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives We see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone having left their old lives behindbr br The acting is top notch from both of them They seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes You can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual moviebr br Though this movie really doesnt take us to any new ground in these types of films the fact that the acting is well done and the story isnt too flawed lets me recommend itbr br I will say however it will probably go away soon I dont believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge Christmas season of movies starting in a week or so See it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses
Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August a single mother whos the working definition of the word dreamer and her solemn pragmatic daughter Adele wanting to make a fresh start in a big city moves them from Wisconsin to Californiabr br Decent if not exceptional or particularly memorable with some serious and sad moments It pushes some emotional buttons thats for sure Best thing it offers is a solid cast and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at timesbr br Could be better could be worsebr br I gave this one seven out of ten
Wayne Wangs direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than Slums of Beverly Hills which covers remarkably similar ground The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting Real chemistry there This film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration Susan Sarandons character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent She amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic And Natalie Portman deflects each attack on her characters ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child untainted by the smug cynicism of the Natasha Lyonne character in Slums of Beverly Hills Portmans character is an adolescent with dignity under stress an unusual creature in modern films The film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard I highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained
A MUST SEE documentary-----This movie had so many things to consider while watching it It was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named Brenton Butler He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida It shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing The police little to investigate the crime Brentons lawyer Patrick McGuinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client He tells the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beatings against his young client to get him to confess The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was questioned McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored He questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard Brenton say to one of the investigators and he challenges their own words McGuinness investigates with Ann Finnell each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not The movie shows the Butlers as a loving Christian family who have faith in their sons innocence and faith that God will set Brenton free They visit him in jail and pray with him there to encourage him There are scenes of group prayer for Brenton the lawyers the Judge and everyone involved in this case I am a white and I was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks It was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man Police have a hard job and I believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie I think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the Judicial system including Judges police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it
I saw this movie last night on HBO & didnt expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO But it happened & you will too Its a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville Florida and subsequent investigation arrest & trial of a 15 year old boybr br Watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society This film was most deserving of an esteemed Oscar - youll be moved to tears
This is an extraordinary film As a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the American justice system its frightening For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court In truth the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty or a guilty man being free Every citizen has a right to justice whether a perpetrator or a victim But do they get it? The film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries Ive seen
Art imitates life imitates art Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the DA in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again The music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience
Anyone that is looking for an episode of Law and Order or CSI would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this casebr br A murder took place and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it? Sure the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently He must have shrunk reversed his age by 5-10 years and changed clothesbr br The police made absolutely no effort - and they admitted it! The did no forensics on any of the evidence they questioned no other witnesses and they beat a confession out of a 15-year-oldbr br The saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in Jacksonville Florida Let everyone now start talking about Southern justice
Very good film Very good documentarybr br Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted narcissistic heartless swines their one eyed parents community and environment raised them asbr br I tip my lid to Pat McGuinness Can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation? We need his integrity endurance intelligence clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big businessbr br All the animals come out at night - whores skunk pussies buggers queens fairies dopers junkies sick venal Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets Pat McGuinness should be the first drops of that real rain The people who control this earth are animals They need to be drownedbr br Im just in shock Walking the night is scary business The inhuman howling and cackling is of detectives in Murder On A Sunday Morning In Pat McGuinness blazing spotlight they look horribly caught horribly guilty and ready for a just and horrible drowningbr br It is exceptionally satisfying in a world in which the punters play a rigged game to see justice done and to see every narcissistic felon drown like the pathetic human rats they arebr br How does it feel you railroading abominable snaky fingers of the law? How does it feel to have your rigged prosecution your rigged confession your rigged detective work found out for what it really was? How does it feel? br br I hope it twists like a knife you miserable one eyed nothings
You think the police are always rightbr br You believe that eye-witnesses are always rightbr br You believe the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98% of a basic investigationbr br You believe a US city might have a few bad apples in law enforcement but that the good cops will quickly nip those who systematically engage in evil-for-evils sake in the budbr br You believe that the possibility of an ex-football lineman being instated as a detective solely because his dad is the county sheriff and being allowed to beat confessions out of randomly-selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to himself could happen in the America of the 1930s but not todaybr br You believe a judge will NOT send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer-by nabbed by the police because it was hot and they did not feel like working that daybr br You believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are exceptions to the rule and an injustice like this could NEVER involve your family member someone in the middle class or someone like YOUbr br You think that you are aware of every terrible indisputable 100% proved outrage of the last 10 years in America--yet you havent seen this film
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramasbr br The story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville FL murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victims husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coercedbr br About half the footage is of the trial; its supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case interviewing witnesses and visiting key locations This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition and placed in logical order The camera work is pretty solid And theres a mildly surprising epilogue
with that carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess: lying deception laziness the list goes onbr br However as an American I was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in todays police force as is reflected with the Duval County Sheriff Departments horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year old accused black youth I shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their abusive work while a young mans LIFE hung in the crooked balance of justicebr br However there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly-paid public defenders stuck by their guns (irony intended) and forced the truth from the detectives I wanted to fly down to Florida and tell anybody with influence what a great public defender team they have in Duval County; those lawyers care about the little man and most importantly for justicebr br The other story line is about faith and family Praises to the accuseds family and their strong Christian (submit any dedicated religion) beliefs and wonderful family values I hope they win their lawsuit against the Duval County Sheriffs Departmentbr br Bravo for justice!!! Bravo for the little guy!!!
I watched this movie with my mother She is 81 yrsold and was raised to be a bigot She even acknowledges this I dont think she really understood what was happening she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty Scary I felt for this child and his family What torture they went through and remained faithful That is true faith Back to the movie I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him I could tell when one the cops was lying He would not look the defender in the eyes His eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin I read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men They were finally found guilty after many years I cant remember the title but it was the same premise Whites doing whatever they want with blacks I am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time if not forever I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white No comment from her I want to commend the director and producer of this film I feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project I am an avid viewer of indy films I feel that they are well written and have substance I am pleased that I happened to grab this movie on the shelf I felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly I feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society
I just saw the movie through Netflix I was intrigued by the way the movie was described but in the end it was better I was moved in many different directions while watching this movie I was filled with hurt hate angry bitternesspain and finally relief To look at the young man accused would break your heart and convince you that they had the wrong person The smugness of the police makes you cring because just as the Rodney King Beating brought to light the brutality of the police this movie brings forth the total lack of moral fiber in these police And the fact that they beat this boy and got away with it only infuriates you morebr br But I have to tell you I fell in love with the attorney Mc Guinness One of my favorite lines when he was telling us what an ahole on of the cops was The cop told him to go on keep sucking on that cancer stick Mc Guinness told the cop I always have a cigarette before sex I was letting him know I was going to screw himbr br I have a new respect for some of the law in this country
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsiquent court case that follows What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wifeThe star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along Fascinating stuff 7 out of 10
I happened to leave HBO on last night following Six Feet Under What ran next has left me speechless What an incredible piece of work I dont just recommend this I MANDATE that you see this Its better than anything Hollywood could ever ruin I just hope they never get their hands on it
I dont need to say much about how good this documentary is--its truly an amazing piece of true narrative The story is simple enough: a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in Florida and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and put on trial with only the public defender and his family on his side Its very enthralling and the public defender is a joy to watch in all his human ways--you cant help but pull for the triumph of justice and the ending fulfills more than could be expected of a true storybr br Its a shame more people havent seen this documentary but hopefully you will find a way to watch it For those interested in race relations in the United States and the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process its well worth your time and effort to find this documentary I give it a 10
You know before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases I mean if they were arrested and charged they must have been guilty I reasoned?br br I formed this opinion over some years You see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of Sydney He frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to bleeding heart lawyers and magistrates He would bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be back on the street by noon It took its toll they wore him down He quitbr br He has argued since not unreasonably I thought that creative evidence gathering to keep the baddies where they belong was well acceptable br br My arguments about the rights of innocent people werent valid he claimed What are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime? he would argue And being a law abiding citizen the weight of his argument convinced me he was right The chances of me or any of my family or friends being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none I thought br br Hmmmmm Well as mentioned earlier seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that br br Im sending him a copy
I absolutely adored this movie For me the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like Boston Legal or Ally McBeal or even LA Law This is REALITY The law is not BS won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt like the Chewbacca defense on South Park) This is a real travesty of justice the legal system gone horribly wrong and the work by GOOD lawyers - not the shyster stereotype who use all of their skills to right it It will do more for restoring your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra movie or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD And most importantly I wept During the film during the featurette included at the end of the DVD - its amazing Wonderful film; wonderfully made Thank God the filmmakers made it
Im pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it cant be accused of unfair bias With absolutely no cause the Jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white foreign tourist They picked a 15 yr old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him In addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager It makes one question whether as a society we should compensate those who are charged imprisoned and subsequently found innocent This docudrama is well produced professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you wont want to take a 1 minute break If you care about social justice dont miss this one It certainly deserved its Oscar
This is a pretty obscure dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades It is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing I dont know It is mesmerizing I was impressed with the night time scenes because it actually looked like night unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule There are a few scenes towards the end the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool This movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat I was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be I couldnt take my eyes off of it and I had to ask myself why?
I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic Also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan who also plays the part of Jarvis in the film In listening to recent blogtalkradio show called the AARF show(Robert Morgan is a co-host)he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and suchthere are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film I think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more Robert is a good man and I hope it does well He has devoted 50+ years of tireless work as a Sassquatch Researcher(which is also one of my interests)and author Check out his show on the paranormal and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II sometime in the near future
Quality entertainment all around The spectacle of Kermit on his bicycle is one thats as memorable as ANY in cinema history Theres just not a bad thing to be said Tons of muppets great cameos slapstick puns whatever you want its here The lovers the dreamers and me INDEED
First of all before I start my review I just read every review for The Muppet Movie here and I cant believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this (Fortunately there was only one) I mean I can understand how someone may not like Star Wars due to the whole Sci-Fi genre but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad br br Okay I will step off my soapbox now and review this moviebr br The Muppet Movie came out when I was seven All of my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie so I think I saw it about four times in the first month in theatersbr br As a child many things attracted me to this and all the other Muppet movies & TV shows The singing was probably the main one Most of the songs in The Muppet Movie are classics From Rainbow Connection to Im Going to Go Back There Someday theyre entertaining and thought-provokingbr br As an adult I see The Muppet Movie in almost a whole different light Yes the things that thrilled me about it as a kid are still there but its the little jokes and such that are just plain hilariousbr br I mean when you think about it Jim Henson is a sick man br br Kermit is a frog and that is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and could karate chop you into two pieces Fozzie is a stand-up comedian bear Gonzo is a whatever that is infatuated with chickens Then you have two old guys that heckle a piano-playing dog a rock band with a maniac drummer a Swedish chef that you cant understand and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentricbr br Yet for these reasons and more Henson has entertained millions of children and adults giving us all something special to watch and remember him by br br The Muppet Movie will always remain in my heart for many reasons but I think the biggest one is because its a movie unlike a lot of recent childrens movies that I feel comfortable to have my kids watch Plus I dont get bored out of my mind with jokes that are dumbed down to my kids levelbr br Its a great movie that is sure to be remembered forever
This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny entertaining sweet and memorable its difficult to decide where to startbr br From the opening number Rainbow Connection Paul Williamss excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D Frog which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about throughout the story this is one fun moviebr br Essentially its a road trip movie where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain Along the way our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors comedians singers and musicians who coincidentally are muppets like Kermit himself Is this how the Muppets really started? Approximately how it happened Kermit tells usbr br Not since Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World has the cameo formula been used so prolifically and successfully The aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just blink across the screen but others have very memorable cameos Steve Martins amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best Puppeteer Jim Hensons nod to his inspiration Edgar Bergen is especially touchingbr br Anyone who ever watched the Muppets TV show will get to see all of their favorite characters theyre all here The puppetry work is magnificent; look especially for Kermit riding a bicycle (how dey do dat???) In-jokes and references to old movies are everywhere but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit himself An example: when the crooks are terrorizing Kermit and Piggy she affectionately says to her short green and handsome beau I wouldnt give up this evening together for anything would you? Uhhh make me an offer I also love the gunfight at the OK Corral scene: brilliantly absurd sillinessbr br Gotta get Movin right along now but to summarize: a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age or movie genre taste Highly recommended
This is a movie that will brighten up your day for sure Kermit the Frog is just an ordinary frog in his swamp when a talent agent stops by and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to be in movie (lol) On the way Kermit meets Fozzie Bear Miss Piggy Gonzo and his chicken Camilla Rowlf The Electric Mayhem Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker But also trailing Kermit is the proprietor of a restaurant chain Doc Hoppers French Fried Frog Legs All things considered though Kermit and the Muppets make it to Hollywoodbr br This movie is recommended for everyone young and oldbr br It has some wonderful musical numbers like The Rainbow Connection Im Going to go Back There Someday and Movin Right Along The Muppets also use many forms of transportation in this movie Kermit rides a bike Fozzie drives a Studebaker and another car Gonzo takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons (which is one of my favorite moments by the way ;) ) and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally go the rest of the way by the Electric Mayhems bus (Dr Teeth Floyd Janice Scooter and Animal); who meet up with them in the desert after Fozzies car breaks downbr br Even some Sesame Street Muppets make cameo appearances (ie Big Bird is walking along on the road on the way to NYC to break into public television) The end is also a very heartwarming moment Every single Muppet created is in the final scene along with a final Rainbow Connection reprisebr br But those poor Muppets worked so hard on their movie set then it all comes crashing down and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks Youd think everything is ruined and destroyed But the rainbow comes shining through the roof at the end and it all sums up the magic of this film and you know everything will be all rightbr br Perfect 1010 Watch it and youll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie
As Muppet movies go this is easily and clearly the best It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age a solid script and some great Disneyesque songs and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Hensons talent The story is basic and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirablebr br This is simply fun but it is also a well made well written beautifully endearing classicbr br It rates an 8910 frombr br the Fiend :
Looking back on Jim Hensons works years after his death is like taking a look back into another time For unlike most so-called creative types attempting to sell to or worse yet cynically exploit children nowadays Jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child And if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this Labyrinth aside it is 1979s Muppet Movie Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson came to work in childrens television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half-hour show of his own on primetime television The Muppet Movie ends up an affirmation of everything more progressive understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s And as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and bound from speaking about anything lest someone might get offended the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of The Muppet Show is on offer here I have said it in other comments but I must say it here A great light in the world went out the day Jim Henson diedbr br The Muppet Movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next eighty or so minutes In short precise strokes we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors And when the story proper begins boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment The Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets especially Kermit were These were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show They were living things based upon a part of all of us only writ so much more boldly than we are used to As each Muppet was introduced to us in turn we saw another reflection of part of ourselves and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character Hence everyone had a favourite When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal I knew I had found one of mine Nowadays I am more of a Swedish Chef fan but what the heybr br Complementing the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities Can You Picture That? shared an insight into Dr Teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of Henson But the most relevant song to me was Gonzos number asking what he is and where he came from Many of us would spend a lifetime gazing into the stars and like Gonzo saying we knew we would be going back there someday Not that all the songs were so deadly serious of course Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent (or lack thereof) and hit the road If any evidence were required that present-day musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable this number would be it Never before and never again would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another With the puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game the human cast had a lot to live up tobr br Which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal Cameos literally pepper the film with everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas popping in to offer their support Even Richard Pryor the last man one would expect to see in a film about the Muppets appears to set up a hilarious moment Mel Brooks cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when I was a small boy but I suspect that is because Henson knew why I would find it disturbing now The big acting strength though comes from Charles Durning who as Doc Hopper embodies everything both Henson and his audience determined to resist At every junction Hopper comes to either offer Kermit the chance to sell out and betray his own kind Or perhaps offer stops being the right word when Hoppers attempts to ensure Kermits compliance become progressively more forceful and violent The whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the worldbr br Of course Animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them any less of a friend In point of fact Animal turns out to be the best friend that Kermit has in that moment And that has been the core message of every good show or film Henson has been involved in ever since That shunning or dismissing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes There can be little doubt that in todays world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authorities Hensons creature workshop could never have got off the ground To misquote the album title daring to be stupid is one thing but enforcing the choice upon others is another matter The Muppet Movie demonstrates how Henson dared to ask us all to think both inside and outside of the proverbial box There will never be another entirely like him but he never would want us to stop tryingbr br Therefore The Muppet Movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film If we were to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated this would be it
I first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters way back when Seeing it again nearly 30 years later I was surprised at how well it has held up The gags are still funny the interaction between characters works great and the cameos come off better than ever (Steve Martins has to be the best one) br br My kids (9 11 and 14) all loved it and the music is good enough that they are still humming the tunes many days laterbr br I would suggest that before seeing the movie you should view at least a half-dozen episodes of the Muppet Show to get a sense of the back-story behind the characters otherwise the movie wont make all that much sense
The Muppet movie is an instant classic I remember the opening scene with the birds eye view of the swamp and Kermit starting into (in my opinion) the most loved song in the history of songs At this point my mom would always sing along with Kermitbr br Watching this title as a young adult it makes me smile I can still sing along to my hearts desire Like many Muppet films there are in jokes for adults that are( In my opinion) still funny today My favorite line of all time is actually from this film its the last line spoken by my green goggle eyed hero Kermit Lifes like a movie  Write your own ending Thats what I intend to do! Thank you Jim Henson
Why are there so many songs about rainbows and whats on the other side? Kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of The Muppet Movie while singing his signature song The Rainbow Connection As time goes by the question and the movie only gain profunditybr br Im going to forgo the review of this movie as a childrens comedy but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing yearbr br As the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me I hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyones life because we all dream And that is what this movie is about Its not just a bunch of puppets-- its a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams which is a good lesson for everyonebr br And while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good theyre not a fair judge of the movie Only The Rainbow Connection and the powerful emotions it will realize And it all fits in: Rainbow Connection is the Muppet Movie and vice versa Its existentialism meets childrens entertainment-- theres no simpler way to describe it
A delight from start to finishbr br If you dont like the Muppets then I just have to feel sorry for you This terrific film doesnt simply cash in on the Muppets popularity -- its a well-conceived and well-written film in its own right Its got great songs and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in Jim Hensons creations and which is most personified in the character of Kermit the Frog I always responded to this as a kid and its what makes the Muppets still enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me crazybr br A huge cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this film feel like a kiddie-sized version of Around the World in 80 Days except that its about 80 times betterbr br Grade: A
I enjoyed THE MUPPET MOVIE very much It was the first of the Muppet movies and is by far the best because its so creative and fresh With later films the ideas just didnt seem quite so original But here we get to see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding bikes (an incredibly difficult scene) an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun I loved every minute the Muppets were performing and I would have rated the film a lot higher except for one serious problem In this and most subsequent Muppet films some powers that be felt there was a need to include lots of non-Muppets--in particular many many cameos by stars Some worked fine (such as Charles Durnings) but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding halt Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan Yes he was an amazing man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew but the tiny scene hes in just wasnt needed nor were most of the cameos Still despite this big complaint its a great film for the entire family--from the kids to even the most demanding adults
The first feature-length adventure of Jim Hensons beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree swampy surroundings for the bright lights (egged on by stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who overheard him singing); on the way he meets Fozzie Bear (a pitiful stand-up comedian at James Coburns El Sleazo Café who has Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn a patron!) the piano-playing dog Rowlf bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back funky band egomaniacal beauty queen Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presided over by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen) etc All the while Kermit et al are pursued by frogleg burger magnate Charles Durning and reluctant acolyte Austin Pendleton sold cars ice cream and balloons to by respectively Milton Berle Bob Hope and Richard Pryor served food by insolent waiter Steve Martin nearly brainwashed by mad German scientist Mel Brooks and finally land an audition in the offices of movie mogul Orson Welles (who has Cloris Leachman for a secretary)! The pleasant song score comes courtesy of Paul Williams who also makes an appearance as the resident pianist at El Sleazos For the record I have recently acquired four of the subsequent Muppet movies and should be watching them in the weeks to come when their turn falls due
Ive Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie But Just The Half Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kellys Friends House The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious They Learn That If They Believe In The End Of The Rainbow Anyone Can Make It No Matter How Small No Matter How Green(Which Was Included In The Trailer)br br Kermit Is My Favorite Protagonist(Which Means It Describes The Main Character) And So Are The Other Muppets Mel Brooks Was Amazing When He Played Professor Max Krassman The Scene Where Miss Piggy Saves Kermit By Doing Kung Fu On Those Guys It Was So Coolbr br The Muppet Movie Is The Best Jim Henson Film With The Most Hilarious Characters And People Will Cherish For His Successful Film
If I rate the film maybe a bit high you can blame it on sentiment This is one of the first movies that I remember seeing and totally loving I saw it at the drive-ins here in California in the late 70s I was already a big fan of The Muppet Show on TV so I was primed for the movie and the movie did not disappoint Basically it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from vaudeville into a road movie Kermit the Frog is on a quest to become famous; not because he wants to take champagne baths and ride in a private jet but because he wants to make millions of people happy Of coursebr br Along the way he picks up all his beloved muppet friends most endearingly Fonzie Bear who he meets at a seedy bar doing stand-up They sing Movin Right Along a song that has always charmed me with its upbeat melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery He also encounters enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie including comedy luminaries like Richard Pryor Steve Martin Edgar Bergen Milton Berle and Mel Brooks Brooks in particular has a rather dull bit and you are left feeling that Henson could have cut a few of these cameos out if he wasnt afraid of offending the stars Anyway as befits a road trip movie like this the very first person he meets is Dom DeLuisebr br The ending is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the 4th wall that you will find in any childrens movie The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling all about them when a real rainbow pierces the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery Im sure this was meant to relate to some of Jim Hensons own personal or spiritual experiencesbr br This is the best movie with Muppets by a long shot If you or anyone else was wondering why the Muppets were so popular back in the 70s considering how poor the movies have been for the last few decades I think this film has at least aged well enough to provide a clue
The Muppet Movie br br directed by br br James Frawleybr br Kermit the Frog and friends relive the tales and stories of how they all came togetherbr br The Muppets star in their first feature film bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture The story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts The well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction The cameos arent just thrown in either but written in as interesting characters making one of the many peaks for our furry friends
I am 17 and a biased Muppet fan and while I love Treasure Island Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them It is enormously entertaining thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl and the film looks lovely with some beautifully staged musical numbers Speaking of the songs I really liked them sure they arent the best song score out of the Muppet franchise but they were very nice to listen to especially Never Before Never Before is now one of my favourite Muppet songs along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate The Muppets as usual were fantastic particularly the always delightful Miss Piggy and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was great And what a brilliant human cast- from Bob Hope to Orson Welles from Madeleine Kahn(the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like Whats Up Doc? Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor all of whom made memorable guest appearances if careful not to overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic film 1010 Bethany Cox
Who doesnt remember The Muppet Movie???br br Kermit the Frog is now an American culture icon What child doesnt appeal to this character?br br As the first actual Muppet film the movie simply called The Muppet Movie did very well Kermit takes a Hollywood agents advice and goes out of his home swamp to respond to the ad Along the way he meets up with a pig a bear chickens a rock band and a few other quality puppets Watch for dozens of cameo appearances like Madaline Kahn Steve Martian Richard Pryor Mel Brooks and several more I grew up watching this movie and I loved it
A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets created by Jim Henson & Co have been made but The Muppet Movie was the first one of them all and the first in the original trilogy which also features The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan It was released seven years before I was born so I obviously didnt get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released) However I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood mostly after Hensons premature death in 1990 I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties after hearing the soundtrack Unsurprisingly I liked it at the time and revisiting it in recent years hasnt exactly been disappointingbr br One day while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing Rainbow Connection a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown Kermit takes his advice and goes west He soon meets Fozzie Bear an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant and convinces him to come along The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot As a frog Kermit is disgusted by this so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie On their road trip across the country Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermits love interest) and Gonzo Unfortunately as they all try to make their way to Hollywood Doc Hopper assisted by Max is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chains mascot so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger! br br One thing many people praise this film for is the songs and I can understand why There is of course the Oscar-nominated Rainbow Connection at the beginning and more good tunes follow such as Kermit and Fozzies catchy road song Movin Right Along and Im Going to Go Back There Someday a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo Never Before Never Again the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit is the only one I would consider rather weak and their romance seems awfully sudden The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable just like they are on TV and some of them provide a lot of the humour including Fozzie making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up and well if youre familiar with these famous Muppets you should know what to expect from each of them Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the Insolent Waiter Also its not 100% comedy There are serious parts of the film which they also did wellbr br Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing Muppets from Space (one of the Muppet movies made after Hensons death released in 1999) for the first time last year I was very disappointed when I saw that film which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters! Not only is that movie not very funny I also think its a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets as I stated in my review of it! However I cant say I think the same of any of that movies predecessors including this one released twenty years earlier The Muppet Movie seems to be the most popular of the bunch and since it has so much to like not just for kids thats understandable I highly doubt theres much left to say about The Muppet Movie that hasnt been said at some point in the past thirty years but today it remains good family entertainment
I have always loved The Muppets Though most childrens entertainment then wasnt that likable The Muppets was The Muppets are very very funny They are probably the most likable childrens characters ever br br Not only did The Muppets have their own show They also have starred in many films from The Muppets Christmas carol to The Muppets treasure Island The first Muppets movie The Muppet movie was also like the show and the other films excellentbr br The Muppet movie is about how they all got started Kermit the frog used to live in a swamp Until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood So Kermit takes off for Hollywood Along the way he runs into lots of people such as Fozzie Bear Gonzo the great and Miss Piggy Also an evil man is trying to capture Kermitbr br All of the Muppet films are highly enjoyable I mean they are all very funny This film has many film appearances Such as Steve Martin Mel Brooks Elliot Gould Carol Kane Richard Pryor and Orson Welles The Muppet films are all very enjoyable I hear that Jason Segel is going to star in one soon I cant wait to see it
I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10br br The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood The laughs and gags are classic muppetism I am glad these films are still around for the next generation I hope I never out grow the magic of the muppets
This film is one of my fondest childhood memories Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading Hollywood singing and dancing with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit Fozzie Bear doing his best as everyones manager and a generous cast of extras delivering a film that turned out to be okey dokeybr br Kermits melancholy ukulele number Rainbow Connection was nominated for an Oscar that year but was beat out by Norma Raes It Goes Like It Goes Ill pick Kermits song any day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasysomeday theyll find it the rainbow connections the lovers the dreamers and me!
The first feature length Muppet Movie and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos keeps to a simple but original plot classic Muppet lame jokes Paul Williams genius in song writing and Electric Mayhem madness and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets Only Croft has come close to Hensens genius with puppets Half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actoractress still alive???? I can only hope Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive Kermit and Company from the deadly grasp of Disney
Who doesnt love the muppets?! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside So I guess whats important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special I dont remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly In fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the magic transcends all that other stuff Tis indeed what movies are made ofbr br So how does the film achieve these things? Hmmm nice question! Stumped am I? Lets see Really I feel like its quite simple The filmmakers believe in their material and dont take themselves too seriously in the process I probably wouldnt say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack) A zest You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures They also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearingbr br Generally I get the impression that the people that made the movie just werent afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session Lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance Maybe I dont feel I have much to say about it because I was half-asleep when I saw it (andor as I write this review) Anyway Im sort of semi-repeating myself here but I really liked the sense of family the movie had Full of love I suppose you might say Again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlesslybr br And to repeat myself once more one of the films best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly so The Muppet Movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so Same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that Anyway if that sounds sappy I also reckon it was pretty hilariousbr br So all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to Plus it features lots of great music! Highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released All these years later at 37 and I had no qualms hiring it on DVD Great entertainment for all ages And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See:br br Why are there so many songs about rainbows And whats on the other side? Rainbows are visions but only illusions And rainbows have nothing to hide So weve been told and some choose to believe it I know theyre wrong wait and see Someday well find it the rainbow connection The lovers the dreamers and mebr br Who said that every wish would be heard and answered When wished on the morning star? Somebody thought of that and someone believed it And look what its done so far Whats so amazing that keeps us stargazing And what do we think we might see? Someday well find it the rainbow connection The lovers the dreamers and mebr br All of us under its spell We know that its probably magicbr br  Have you been half asleep? And have you heard voices? Ive heard them calling my name  Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors? The voice might be one and the same Ive heard it too many times to ignore it Its something that Im sposed to be Someday well find it the rainbow connection The lovers the dreamers and mebr br Laa da daa dee da daa daa La laa la la laa dee daa doo
First of all id like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind It is the best out of all the excellent Muppet movies and every other movie out there! so BOO-YA for jim Henson!br br This Movie is the first of all the Muppet movies and the best (boo ya) Its about a Frog (kermit) who tries to make to hollywood along with the awesome friends he meets on the way comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are bound to become classics including the rainbow connectionbr br in conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest thing EVER! If you havnt already seen it then get off your computer and get you tushy to your nearest video store!!! (if they dont have the muppet movie id sue them BIG TIME )

Yknow its very interesting watching this half the people involved with it are now deadbr br Anyways its been a long time since Ive watched anything Muppet related but this stuff is pure gold Im a great fan of puns and this movie has them quite well placed but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: its not really high-speed childrens pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the characters depth its just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to gobr br Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character His voice and the expressions on his puppet-face are fantastic But above all he points out why hes popular--he can sing and make jokes too!--but more appropriately why hes so endearing--he without any effort inspires everyone to search for their dreams In the meantime he also has to deal with himself which is an uncommon theme in family moviesbr br It also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there some to great effect others to a little less (I think Mel Brooks part was just a bit overplayed do you?) Some parts of the film are just kind of odd But its highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different directionbr br Moving right alongbr br --PolarisDiB
Jim Hensons The Muppet Movie is a charming funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters great story and great wit that it is irresistable The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteered and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey across America to follow his dream in Hollywood Along the way he meets Fozzie Bear The Great Gonzo (my favorite) Miss Piggy Rolf and DR Teeth and the electric mayhembr br This film has so many good things I cant even say them But it is memorable and every time I think of a puppet or muppet I will think of this film Look for cameos from Mel Brooks Dom DeLouise Paul Williams Madeline Kahn Bob Hope Richard Pryor Steve martin Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey) Elliot Gould Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles Excellent and spectacular one of the best films of the 70s A++
In many ways the perfect movie The Incredible Journey and Horatio Alger tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of existentialism In essence the travails of the muppets boil down to the finale song of the movie: Lifes like a movie write your own ending keep believing keep pretending They create their own reality which has all the trappings of every epic tale: a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily a obstacle-laden journey; an ever-increasing group of like-minded individuals for camaraderie; a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption; and a big-budget Hollywood ending because darn it all they CANbr br Only Jim Henson could pull this off He walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without swerving too long or too hard into either Of course it seems odd that invest such weight into a film starring puppets but in the end perhaps they are the perfect uh puppet to make these points The movies atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream the happy ending unnecessary cameos and bursting into song at the drop of a hat Usually these aspects are anathema to quality in film but the self-deprecating manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt-free viewing One of the few films that can truly be called suitable for all agesbr br The other muppet-related films (including The Empire Strikes Back) while palatable do not touch the simple grace of this film Take for instance the musical number Hope that Something Better Comes Along the duet of Kermit and Rowlf Amusing in its vaudevillian goofiness yet makes a bitingly crucial point about the motivations behind life choices Brilliant
MINOR SPOILERSbr br Misunderstood classic remains one of Hensons finest and most personal films It may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhls snappy screenplay and Paul Williamss knockout songs Now while these things are admittedly great as is the movies formal playfulness (screenplay-within-the-screenplay film break etc) what distinguishes The Muppet Movie from the other Muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture Its a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again Throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the Muppets have made it: Piggy abandons Kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent Gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performers life on the road in his haunting Im Going to Go Back There Someday and worst of all Kermit is continually tortured and tested by Doc Hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes (One can only wonder what Henson would have made of his familys management of the company after his death) Kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final Magic Store number questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way All this is punctuated with the expected Muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent But The Muppet Movie isnt just another jokefest as the rest of the diminishing-return Muppet films would become No its a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and its every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago 95 out of 10
This film is about aging Geisha in post war Tokyo Okin played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara lends money to two other ex Geisha Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it Tamae has a son Otomi a daughter who during the film announce theyre leaving them while Okin never a mother gets visits from two men in her past who it turns out just want money from her Its a compelling tale of what choices you make what you do to get through life and who youre responsible and beholden to Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding less than compassionate Okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her but at the same time almost envy her At a time when great films were made by Ozu Mizoguchi Kinoshita and Kurosawa amongst others Mr Naruse is right up there with him If you have a region free DVD player you should attempt to find the two Naruse box sets released in England I think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant That they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi This is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired Geishas Whatever happens when such a woman ages and loses her charm and mystique? Well for those who are interested watch this film One: Okin is successful as a money-lender but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful Okin doesnt have any children but the other do Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her and is excited Naruse is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists characters Bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness and ones life-worth Very good film indeed
A look at three geishas who are way past their prime Now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present Kin (played by Floating Weeds Haruko Sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her The other two Nobu and Tamae wish they could land husbands but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will Meanwhile their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other) Tamae is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man Nobus concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature but they are also (understandably) self-serving After her son leaves shell be alone A bit into the film two of Kins former clients come looking for her one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him the other one of her handsomest clients Unfortunately he comes for her money not her love The way Ive described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing but its really not Sad but not fatally so Its more bittersweet Unfortunately I only marginally liked Late Chrysanthemums The story seems better when I look back on it but it is very slow and dull I actually nodded off twice during the film and I wasnt at all tired before I started it This is the kind of film that I can appreciate more than like; it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of Ozus more famous films 710
Mikio Naruses examination of the lives of three idling constantly complaining single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy she is the only one of the three that has no children The other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income because neither of them work Complications ensue when the kids decide to get married (though not to each other) and leave home This leads to the bitter grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender Meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy despite her fortunes She has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her The three characters are all neck-deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or at the very most toss complaints back and forth to each otherbr br Late Chrysanthemums is very slow-moving and not much actually happens but Naruse like all great directors has the ability to do much with very little I havent seen much of his work but I suspect that this isnt his best even though it is very good The problem I think is that it all doesnt seem to amount to much But the film is full of good points Although it is cynical it isnt overly so Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self-made misery While the film isnt a must-see it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known (outside of his own country) director precious little of which is available on video here in the U S
For me Late Chrysanthemums was interesting not only because it was my first film of Naruse I completely enjoyed but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s work Ive seen This doesnt mean innovative editing in the way Godard would introduce it with Breathless in 1959 but quite the oppositebr br The editing was as fluent as in the best of Hollywood films from the 30s40s but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way he was telling his story Unlike them it never purposefully accentuated anything or tried to make itself invisible but together with the cinematography made me feel like I was traveling on a gentle stream constantly feeling the waves beneath me like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle In this sense the film was comparable to Ozus and Mizoguchis work but somehow even more subtlebr br What was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself similar to the remarkable camera-work in Dreyers Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943) which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to usbr br I feel that Naruses editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious The wonderful sets and settings shouldnt be forgotten either! I found the story itself to be rather conventionalbr br The narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way and I thought that the first half of the film was setting up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations Unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and and formulaic compared to the set up (though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other - less complex - film) Somehow I felt that he failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven Maybe he should have kept them intact This criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film especially since the procedure is again reminiscent to the way Ozu dealt with the plot in his films Unfortunately I havent yet the feeling that Naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in his films conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion The best efforts I have seen to date - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds  1955) and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds  1967) - sustained the energy he had built throughout the narrative while delivering poignant and resonant endingsbr br This is already more than most directors are able to do and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium In this regard and considering the resonance of the last two films Ive seen by him he may have already become one of my favoritesbr br The only problem I have at the moment is where Im going to see more of his films on the big screen
Sadness and nostalgia permeate Late Chrysanthemums a 1954 film by Japanese auteur Mikio Naruse now undergoing a retrospective of his long unavailable films thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi Late Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geishas now middle-aged whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret Performance are uniformly outstanding particularly that of Haruko Sugimura who starred in films by Ozus Late Spring Floating Weeds and Tokyo Story among others Sugimura portrays Kin a former Geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speakbr br She has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money particularly real estate speculation and loaning money to her friends Nobu (Sadako Sawamura) Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki) all former geishas Kins friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet Both Tomi and Tamae are in the process of losing their children Tamaes son is leaving to work in the coalmines in Hokkaido and Tomis daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man Both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitablebr br Two male friends visit Kin Seki a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide and Tabe (Ken Uehara) another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years Her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money Naruse cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as Kin confronts Tabe and Tomi and Tamae console each other over the loss of their children The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who though their future does not seem bright refuse to see themselves merely as victims Late Chrysanthemums has the simplicity humor and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of Ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way
Subtle delicate touchingbr br A young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy History of a coming -out and anatomy of relationshipbr br Soft ambiguous gestures slices of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expressionbr br Two men a girl a afternoon on beach some words and a gift Religious traces and a pantheist vision Cercle of light and expression nooks of an ordinary day and hot eveningbr br A erotic chaste film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only instruments for good definition of a universe with sensitives valuesbr br Pledge for self- discover universe of beauty exploration the sign of Ozon and same nostalgic air of every creation Robe dete is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream to look with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people
i expected it to be good after id seen some other ozons superb moments and read much about it but this movie is brilliant - clever very bright (emotionally and visionally) perfect in all moments every movement is there for a reason everything fits so closely and primordially true and honest this is the movie about the beauty and innocence; about its simplicity
Theres not a dull moment in Francois Ozons Robe dEte Its surprising how much is packed into this short film While reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach On returning to the beach they find that all his clothes have been stolen She lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day He rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl His gay companion is sexually excited Early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended She suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance Its a light-hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes
Im just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon Ive seen only 4 films so far and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12 and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundingsbr br This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for goodbr br The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozons films so it doesnt grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might) Watch for the feelings not for their objectsbr br Very nice and fleeting truly like a summer romance and while being a relaxation to thought and mind it gives some food for the soul
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind One knows its going to about a mute one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentimentbr br Well forget it The movie starts with a little black humour and then gets started From then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of Moscow All right it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder But this movie doesnt let you gobr br Its like the old gangster movies but then without any glamour at all and in Russia And thats one of the most important aspects of this movie: its situated in Russia This does have a great impact on the movie according to me it makes it better Everything becomes simple and basic life is without nonsense This could be a great potential for more movies in the future gangster movies about the Russian mafiabr br It is a beautifull and terrifying movie Its horror but you cant feel but sympathy for the little mute One last advice: dont look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well
First half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally Im not easy to scare but second half of this thriller didnt work quite a well but still very scary! A good thriller than use simple ways to make good horror Lowbudget set in Russia unknown cast and made in Europe but still great fun and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well!
If you want to see a true thriller rent this!!! Its not from the director or screenwriter of Scream doesnt feature overacting overpaid TV actors passing off as stars and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza Instead youll get a top-notch edgy very strong (in violence) yet thrilling nailbiter
Well this film came on on a workday at 230am The cute little actress who played Billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes I was held captive to my television till the very end It has you on the edge of your seat then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequencesbr br The only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film causing certain sequences to drag just a little Nonetheless it was still very entertaining and I recommended it to all my co-workers the next day
Mute Witness is a modest yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves The film  written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller  is a tense action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery Mute Witness handles about the vicious topic of snuff-movies and is effectively set in Russia  SPOILERS  Since the production costs are cheaper there a US film crew temporarily moves to Russia for shooting a horror film An old hangar is used as film location The female make-up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff-movie! Shes caught and tries to escape but since shes a mute she cant cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly The girls life is in real danger now since theres a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they dont want the witnesses to be alive  End Spoilers  Mute Witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody Some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end Regarding the similar topic Id say its definitely better than the more famous 8 mm directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage The acting in Mute Witness isnt great but the leading actress (whos Russian herself) looks really cute Sir Alec Guinness makes a special appearance too And a very cool one I may say Surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares
This is a VERY good movie I give it a 10br br Its very different in that its kind of a long stalking scene all the way through The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable waybr br She sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time) I wont reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience but rest assured: its very believable well played very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great endingbr br Dont miss this movie
Superbly crafted low-budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as wellbr br The cast play it very well although Richards self-centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times The tiny two-scene cameo by Sir Alec Guinness oozing menace as the crime czar of Moscow is simply the icing on the cakebr br Well worth repeated viewing but not on dark nights when youre all alone!
An intense thriller about a mute movie make-up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night After she tries to get away from the murder scene she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness This movie leaves you on the edge of your seat
This is definitely one of the most scary and spell-binding films ever made You are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end Even though there are some plot holes it keeps being exciting to the final showdown Besides 8 MM and Peeping Tom this is one of the best films about Snuff Movies a taboo theme of our culture If you like the SCREAM Trilogy you will probably love that one
I love this movie ! I think Ive seen it 5 times already (it was quite a success in France and they often play it on TV) Ok its a thriller and there is great tension But mostly (and specifically in the second part) it is absolutely hilarious ! And very original The directing and photography are just splendid
Ive waited 9 years to watch this film simply because i never saw it advertised on TV Eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait Its much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because its all at a fairly quick pace with no drawn out creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes Only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but dont let that put you off in any way What lies beneath - over hyped and crap Mute witness - low budget not hyped at all and very good
The plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well There is a plenty of comic relief too Some things do not make a lot of sense (eg the first chase scene why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?) The Russians actually speak Russian without accent but the cars are extremely strange with models spanning like 50 years and so the place seems weirdly out of time Overall if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well
I enjoyed the acting in this movie Except for the sister She reminded me of Janice on Friends I could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious br br My main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law The guy falling out of the exploding car? Maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital maybe then I could have gone for the ending I think somebody needed to die in the execution scene Mainly the brother-in-law He was such a pain in the ass anyway Or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute I could have even bought into the brother-in-law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films br br It is worth watching again and as I always say it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author
This is without doubt one of my favourite horror films ever! I really cannot believe that it didnt gain much more popularity when it was released especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual Wes Craven sequels and copycat horrors Mute Witness has all the style suspense and quickfire plot twists of a HitchcockDePalma movie coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot It never promises to be any more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it isbr br The plot centres on Billie Hughes - a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a Russian factory By a series of events she finds herself accidentally locked in and stumbles on the filming of a snuff moviebr br One of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made As the main character is mute she cannot make a noise - something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie and a curse in othersbr br The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well Even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek nod to both Hitchcocks Psycho as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenesbr br While the acting can be hammy at times the whole film does hold it together not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to endbr br All in all a hugely overlooked well-paced and action packed psycho-thriller which I would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual FreddyJasonScreamMichael MyersDamien regurgitations at halloween
One of my all-time favourite movies Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia I would so I could enjoy this movie as much as I did that very first time Its still enjoyable second and third times round but I found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills werent unexpected If you want a see a film that you truly wont be able to predict the ending of then I highly recommend this film Its chilling shocking full of suspense and theres also loads of humour to help you through it too If you watch this film and dont love it I truly question your sanity!
I dont know how this film went unnoticed for so longbr br I saw this film on TV i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film i missed the first probably  10 minutes but that does not matterthis film literally gripped me it is a real spine chillerbr br The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effectu do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to so it is all the more tenseEven though there are many new faces their performances were top classbr br The filmmakers play with your mind just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest The shock fear horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the filmbr br The well written situations n twistsfast camera movements slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller This film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock br br I could not even move from the TV even during the commercial breaks  i was the helpless MUTE WITNESS to this superb film
Man I never laugh so much this year and its pretty hard to make me laugh While I expected some Hostel-style movie the smile came to my face even from the beginning This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed victim messing the whole set until she finally die Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us the viewers that Mute Witness is not a typically horror moviebr br The main character the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina Her performance is top-notch; her character cant speak so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensateAnd oh boy she did a wonderful job Her sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or the fiancée or the wife of the in-film director (Evan Richards) They were both very funny most of the time I wont spoil more but the scenes following the bathtub moment with them two the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedybr br The plot get twisted near the end possibly misleading at one particular moment But dont worry Such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-girl-friend
In todays world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it Movies like Psycho and Blair Witch while being great in suspense (both with great build ups) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them With Mute Witness a rare treat I stumbled upon this film and watched it scared witless in the middle of the night I was scared by the menacing Russian ambience the snuff theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the (amusing which always leads to likeable) characters could meet the end at any second Since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations It also has Fay Ripley in a rare movie role watch and prepare to be excited scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways
I couldnt stop watching this movie though it was far past my bedtime br br Comparisons to Hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you It walks a wonderful line between real immediate suspense and a dark distancing humor Like many of Hitchs heroes our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardybr br The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out Right from the opening shots they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication; who is to be trusted and who is a monster The plot twists and turns unpredictably Suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork imagery music -- but most simply THE EYES of the characters which sends raw fear right into you br br A warning: there is some frighteningly real gore as well as some nudity The horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage-slasher picbr br And a teen-slasher pic it AINT The characters are quirky and feel like real people for one thing -- a couple (including the heroine) you may even find endearing as I did There will be no mistake youre watching a movie made for grown-ups I mean Alec Guinness is in it briefly and you know he didnt NEED the work!br br Pop this in the VCR some night when you cant sleep   and dont want to yet
The story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie Then the story gets more and more outrageous The Main character portrayed by Marina Sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role This could have been a super-great movie had the ending been more realistic
It is always a well-known and important directorial device to set up the atmosphere of a film within the first 5 minutes In the crucial opening scenes the film should assert itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film Here in Mute Witness we find a prime example of thisbr br Scene spoiler br br In the first 5-10 minutes the film opens to a very Hitchcockian scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment with the radio on Shes wandering around applying lipstick dolling herself up and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose Of course the serial killer is in her house and monitoring her moves knife in hand She hears a noise looks in a room and there is her partner in a pool of blood At the very point of her screams she turns around to be faced with the knife-wielding maniac who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying actbr br then something odd happens As the woman convulses in her death throes the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim perish Before he finds his lighter his cigarette is litfrom someone else in the room! The camera pans out and we realise that there are more and more people in the room some taking notes some filming some recording the death and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die and making a very hammy job of it too When the audience realises whats going on and the whole scene is part of a film the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humourbr br End Scene Spoiler br br I have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons Firstly it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma with some very disorientating and even blackly humorous moments - It conveys a central subject matter (that of the difference between a movie screen death and a snuff film death an issue which is elaborated on later in the film) and finally it introduces the viewer to the characters all as silently as possiblebr br The plot of Mute Witness centres around Billy Hughes an American special effects make-up artist who is working on the set of the film being shot in a large warehouse in Moscow Billy cannot speak but she communicates in sign language through her sister After the end of an evenings filming Billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident and in her attempt to escape is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film but turns out to be a snuff movie Suddenly her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and deathbr br Without doubt the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping Billys saving grace and her handicap is the fact that she isnt able to utter a sound (In fact in my opinion one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isnt chock-full of women screaming) There are some utterly disturbing moments and some superb set-pieces of real suspense (The corridoor and the elevator shaft are perfect examples) The timing is fluid and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itselfbr br The second half of the film introduces new concepts While there are still several suspenseful moments the focus is on plot twists New characters are introduced and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on While there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film it just doesnt quite measure up to the first half There are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes but there are also some very lame comedy moments (coming specifically from Billys sister and her fiancée who happens to be the director of the movie Billy is working on) that almost ruin the film just because they are badly misplaced andor mistimed and ruin the pace - At the end the twists keep coming at a rapid-fire speed and the climax of the film is appropriately as tense as the first halfbr br There are several things that really make the movie work The barriers of communication that Billy must face both as a mute and as an American in Moscow mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation The actress that plays Billy Natasha Zudina does a wonderful job in the film with an engaging on-screen prescence and a brilliant performance and finally the direction as a whole but most particularly in the first half of the film which truly is a study in Alfred Hitchcocks suspensethriller film techniquesbr br As I have already said though the let-downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added There is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (The sister and the moviemaker) to turn their scenes into some unusual sit-com However despite these shortcomings the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller and ideal for a group viewing at halloween (Certainly better than the usual slasher horror film!)
If you enjoy suspense this movie has it The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense Alec Guinesss appearance was nice but didnt really add to the movie Im not sure if Evan Richards part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot I thought the cinematography was excellent This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful Also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to Andy Clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done I would call it overall good entertainment
I went into this film expecting a slasher and while Mute Witness does take influence from said style of film-making this is much more than just your average slash flick There are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability - blindness is more common (Blind Terror Wait Until Dark Cat oNine Tails to name a handful) but the implications of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character cant speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of Our mute witness is Billy Hughes a make-up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in Moscow She finds herself locked in after hours one night and after attempting to phone her sister for help she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an illicit sex flick but soon turns out to be a snuff movie! She tries to convince the authorities of what shes seen but finds that no one believes her storybr br Recently Hostel made the headlines for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country but this film did it first and actually does a better job Its maybe not quite as nasty as Eli Roths opus but the gore is more effective and since director Anthony Waller (who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with The Guilty) implements a good sense of humour into the proceedings Mute Witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to watch The director certainly has a talent for crafting suspenseful thrill rides as this one never stands still The plot is put into action quickly and Waller constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film The acting isnt bad for a B-movie with young performers Marina Zudina Fay Ripley and Evan Richards delivering good performances The atmosphere is gritty and the Russian locations are suitably unfriendly which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere Overall Mute Witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be The plot flows well and the atmosphere and tension are spot on
Billy Hughes is a mute young lady working for make-up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in Moscow by an American director One night Billy gets locked in the movie studio Later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out Thats when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered while being filmed After escaping the clutches of the murderers Billy informs the authorities only to be red-faced when the men show it was an act Billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importancebr br I dont know how this heart-pounding sleeper passed me by but I thought it was a much older flick Theres one thing though its got to be one of the most jarringly and intense thrillers Ive seen in quite a while Its just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place! The first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation Underling this is a humorously wicked black streak Faults do pop up in the story as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour (or better putter comic relief) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richards characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful In the long run it probably could have done without Despite some cringe moments this aspect didnt hinder my enjoyment of it For me the soft ending they decided to go with just didnt feel rightbr br The interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods So multi-facet was the context and its thrills there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the nervy jolts and unbearable tension are weaved into a range of sudden plot turns and twists Really they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke English and so we are caught up in the confusion too The delicate Marina Zudina gives a harrowing portrayal of the American mute girl Billy The way she able to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability Director Anthony Waller shoots the flick in a rather stylish well-timed and skillful manner without loosing that grimy look that eventuates from its rigid surroundings and a powerfully airy music score persistently nags at you The only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by Alec Guinness The performances by the cast were all fine especially the nail biting turns by Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as the Russian murderersbr br This riveting feature thats mostly made up of unknowns is way better than your average dark thriller Highly Recommended
A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasherhorror genre with savvy self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensionsbr br This movie was MUTE WITNESS Starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie) it told the story of a mute make-up artist Billie who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sisters boyfriend Andy She is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody Overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence a chase ensues and finally she is rescued by Andy who take her home as they alert the police The trouble is there is no body no evidence that anything of the sort took place Even so a mysterious inspector seems to be on Billies side of the storybr br And to say more would be criminal MUTE WITNESS is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller its one that pays its dues to movies like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts deadpan humor Americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless and nail-biting suspense until it seems something must snap Even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots (for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away Very smart
An amazing piece of film that was well-conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat Brilliantly orchestrated in its timing and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release The acting was generally well-done (the Director shouldve asked Alec Guinness for acting lessons) and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as Billy tries to race to the door in the studio) This movie didnt let up since the opening scene
This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seenbr br In fact its so nerve-wracking I havent been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago but I will since I have the DVD There were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watchso if youve got problems and need to escape for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else br br The Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone which she had to do since her character in here is a mute She plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker After the days shooting is done and Billie is about to leave she hears something She takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a snuff film and actually killing someone Billies eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse-type buildingbr br There are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out The first I described above The second scene the climactic one goes on too long and isnt as well done as the first In fact the film should have been trimmed a bit but overall since its so good at keeping our attention then it served its purpose as entertainment
I just finished this movie and my only comment is OH! WOW! Jennifer Beals is ok as the fiancee but Yancy Butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite! Having watched her in WITCHBLADE I was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screenbr br I gotta see THIS movie againif only for Yancy Butler as Corrinne!
I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for Eleanor Bergstein The primary actors (Campbell Scott Jennifer Beals Yancy Butler James Goodwin III Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well selected and played their parts with excellence It was a very uplifting movie that I wish was available on tape or DVD A rare gem
Love this little film that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem SHALL WE DANCE? (not the overblown GereJlo remake) Luckily I found it and taped it when it was showing on a STARZ Promo Weekend because as far as I know its not available on DVD Ill watch just about anything with Yancy Butler (anyone remember the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) in it and she positively shines in this She does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT!! Loved all the other characters in it especially the ones played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (wheres she been all these years?) This is one of those films that I take out from time to time and always come away smiling after watching it Recommended highly!!!
Meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970s this movie plays more like something Mr Schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway A mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in Florida and along the freeway of life the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor The problem is that what DIDNT end up on the cutting room floor probably should have! Now available on DVD its kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost $100 million to produce had it been made in 2004 It rolls along and isnt too difficult to sit through and strangely enough in 2004 were all still pretty much justbr br hopping in our cars and going faster and faster heading nowhere
I found this movie on Netflix and had to add it to my queue I wasnt disappointed when I got it as its just as funny now as when I saw it at a local drive-in theater back thenbr br It builds to a climax nicely with you getting glimpses of the various characters as they begin their trip across America on the Honky Tonk Freeway America on wheels This was a strange comedic role for William DeVane as I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 TV film The Missiles of October and felt no one could have pulled that dramatic character off as well as he didbr br It reminds me a bit of Dick Van Dyke in Cold Turkey where Van Dyke played the local minister DeVanes role as mayor minister and activist was typical for small towns so it makes his character seem amusing and realbr br Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as the spoiled family in the RV was on target for the time as well Anyone who has traveled across country with small children (Are we there yet?) will appreciate those scenesbr br The scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town I grew up in but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns Its sad that many small towns disappeared because of the freeway system and it gives a realistic if humorous view of what they had to do to survive (Used zoo animals anyone?)br br All in all its a lightweight comedy with no particular message but a humorous glance at America during the early 80s Well worth watching if you just need a bit of good cheer
Back in August 81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies big hits like Urban Cowboy Every Which Way But Loose Smokey and the Bandit were all the rage For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose Honky Tonk Freeway as the title hoping it would help the movies box office receipts by drawing in that same Urban Cowboy crowd Instead Honky Tonk Freeway bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title Thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of its time No matter what probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy itbr br Its too bad this movie bombed But I think it would have anyway even if it hadnt been saddled with a poor title Its a movie ahead of its time One could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or great-uncle anyway) to the kinds of comedy made today For its day Honky Tonk Freeway was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didnt get popular in comedy till much later on While clearly its a child of Airplane its more mature and while its certainly no Knocked Up it clearly points in that direction The characters are more comedy-mature in that they are low-key and dont ever think anything they do is anything other than serious The jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situationsbr br But more than that Honky Tonk Freeway is a real time capsule A great look back at the exceedingly early 80s The people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did It was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around thembr br I dont know if my review is helping you but this is really a good sometimes kind of excellent movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger Beverly DAngelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr Terry Garr was just about to become the toast of Hollywood as her next movie after this one was Tootsie which finally made her a star Howard Hessmann was arguably the biggest current star of the the day when this movie was made Back in 1981 Howard Hessmann was the star of the big hit TV show WKRP in Cinncinatti He played its lead character the rascally night DJ Daniel Stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown-up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80s sitcom The Wonder Years There are also several faces that are no longer with us these days its nice to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as a an old married couple on a journey Jessica Tandy would finally pick up her Oscar ten years after this for Driving Miss Daisy There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of her final movie appearances Though shed had a brilliant career she didnt get her Oscar till four years after this in 1985s Trip to Bountiful for which she richly deserved it and she died very soon after getting that awardbr br Plus there are lots of other faces in this movie actors who arent big stars but who have done tons of supporting work Many are familiar even if you cant think of their namebr br This movie is a pleasant little diversion A bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all in a vaguely Altman-esk way end up heading towards Florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of Ticlaw Florida which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to Ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the mapbr br And thats also what this movie is about fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system which had only recently been completed It had taken a generation to build from when it was authorized by congress around 1960 through many years as different parts were built and then went live and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is And people were enchanted by it Everybody by 1980 was pretty much an interstate freeway veteran in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs only on and off ramps and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible By 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom And this was all new then br br The ending is anti-climatic and isnt that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment What makes it great is its the journey not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day Forget its title; instead let it take you down memory lane
A wonderful film ahead of its timebr br I think so In the eightys it was all about winning Greed is Good ? Remember that one ? I have seen this film more that 20 times To me this is a real desert island film I keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that I just love Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin are simply wonderfulAlso Beverly Dangelo Beau Bridges come in at a close second dont get me wrong there are many more great performances in this film and it is also the way it is written that made it for me and I hope you a film that you will want to see over and over I think TV shows like Northen Exposure and now Earl owe a lot to this film but remember it is not a Tom Cruise film
I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid I loved it Whilst I havent watched it recently I am sure I would enjoy it just the same today Its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh The situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mothers ashes (who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion)  the robbers and the nuns This nice humour style is much missed these days Also this movie proved that actor Paul Keenan (DynastyDays of our Lives) was off to a great start I recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video shop
A notorious big budget flop when released This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast Although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end If you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names but you know their faces) heck even the kid from A Christmas Story turns up in a small part Rent if from Netflix if you read this I bet you will enjoy it
In the early 80s I recorded Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable Since then I have waited hoping it would be on DVD Yesterday I found it It is one of the best humorous character studies I ever saw The Old Fashioned episode is priceless At this time (42802) only two have reviewed it One hated it the other loved it If you have a DVD player either rent it or buy it as I did
VERY memorable comedy Its fun to watch the many situations develop and finally converge after a long journey on that greatest collection of eclectic humanity (and the worlds largest honky-tonk) - the great American Freeway Like mad mad world its got loads of contemporary talent old-boy politics good comedic action and dialog Unlike that one it is the target that seeks not the unwitting seekers - they have no idea what they really want as they drift along Americas great road Nor does it carry the weight of having a great fall guy who is saved only in the end by a great belly-laugh But the ending stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent film editing humor and timing and the big city bank scene is hilarious with very original acting by one very talented character in particular The total aplomb of the city dwellers in the face of chaos leaves one feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling The slapstick is funny but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuance and character reactions that are easily missed All in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are good or bad and the goofy situations we find ourselves in It was just meant to be FUNNY and it is!
This movie bombed at the box office and in the voting here but I loved it One measure of a movies worth is how much of it you can still remember after 25 years I wont bore you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes also a good story and great casting The inept robbers are a hoot See it and judge if it ever gets on TCM
This is an interesting hard to find movie from the early 70s starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesnt make the cut as a marine Dressed in baby blue outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home the failed recruits are sent packing Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine Raider Geres character is already jaded and contemplating desertion and he takes advantage of Vincents innocence stealing his baby blue uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway Vincents character whose name is Marion takes Geres outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine Raider Marion hitch-hikes his way into Wyoming and stops at a little Norman Rockwell-like little town In the local café he meets Rose Hudkins who immediately catches his eye Staying with Hudkins parents Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine Raider could still be so innocent The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps as the towns folks go hunting 3 escapees Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt But theres still a happy ending which befuddled me a bit I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway this captures JMV at the peak of his 70s performances BUSTER AND BILLIE BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70s were amazingly good JMV performances He was both an action star and a heart-throb all at the same time!!! He made a lot of quality movies during his career and continued to do so up into the mid 80s with the great TV show Airwolf He does a very good job in this as Hedge quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country He must have performed some of the stunt work as well- there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie-and it looks like hes the guy getting tossed down the river to me! But really at the height of his popularity this movie could have done so much more with JMVs talent and his looks Innocence can only be so interesting Evil as explored in Buster and Billie is much more dramatic! Anyway Glynnis OConnor is delightful as Rose The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting The outdoor scenes are gorgeous - must have been filmed in Canada
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time The opening narrative music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me You either love the movie or hate it Jan Michael Vincent was at his all time best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way This movie is at the top of my all time favorites a shame it isnt available on DVD or VHS anymore The ending was also wonderful John Hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time
SPOILERS Beautifully photographed slice of life home-front WWII love story with Norman Rockwell paintings in the beginning and end of the movie about how a war hero is not just someone who kills for his country but is also someone who thinks for himself and isnt corrupted by the war propaganda thats constantly drummed into his head Washing out of the Marine Corps Marion Hedg Hedgepeth Jan Michael-Vincentis kicked out of boot-camp after five weeks and forced to put on a Baby Blue Marine uniform that shows that he just didnt have it to make the Corps Humilitated and scorned wherever he went as hes going home to St Louis and terrified what his family whom his dad was in the Marine Corps in WWI would think of him in that he couldnt Cut the Mustard as a US Marine br br Hedg stopping in a bar and finds sitting next to him is a Marine member of the fearless and deadly Marine Raiders Richard Gere whom a admiring Hedge buys a beer Making conversation with Richard Hedge is shocked to find out that not only is he being sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles he fought in and combat medals he got but the totally gray hair and mid-thirty looking Richard is going to be 21 next month! Thats what being in the Marine Corps and WWII did to him! Buying Hedge a number of drinks Richard takes the drunk Baby Blue outside and knocks him out taking his Baby Blues and leaves his impressive US Marine uniform with some money in it for Hedge to ware br br As soon as Hedge puts on Richards uniform that fits him perfectly hes confronted by this big drunken US paratrooper who calls himself Cement-Head wanting to have a fist fight with the Marine Raider Hedge doing everything he can to avoid trouble is forced by Cement-Head to belt him after he himself cracked two beer bottle over his cement-head to get himself warmed up for the big bout between MarineHedge and Paratrooper Cement-Head Hedge incredibly floors the big cement headed buffoon knocking him out cold with one punch! I guess the trick is not hitting him in on top of his head a stunned Hedge tell his Cement-Heads fellow GIsbr br Hitch-hiking to this small town of Bidwell Hedge notices this US Military internment camp for Japanese-Americans who are there because their considered a threat to US security Its later in the movie that Hedge shows everyone what a real hero he is not who the people in the town think he is by risking his life to save one of the hated Japs who mindlessly together with two of his friends escaped from the interment camp where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving the scared to death Japanese-American from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the town Hedge in his actions taught the people of Bidwell that not all Japs even those who are American citizens are bad and treacherous banzai screaming suicidal kamikazes like they were thought by the newspapers magazines and movies at the time to think that they werebr br Hedge strikes up a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local diner Rose Hudkins Glynnis OConnorwhos just crazy about him that even Hedge at first thinks that its his uniform not him that impressed her Later when Hedge admits to Rose that hes not what she and her parents thinkA US Marine Raiderthat he is Rose had by then gotten to know the sweet and caring washed-out marine so well that it didnt matter to her at all what he was supposed to be a Marine a Paratrooper or a Post Office worker it was what was inside his heart that really countedbr br The film has a number of touching and beautiful scenes in it between Hedge and Rose that shows how movies used to be made years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in movies today that involved two people in love with each otherbr br The way the film accurately not phony baloney shows the true feelings of average Americans back then in 1943 about the war in general and Japanese in particular couldnt have been done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste Baby Blur Marine does its best not to be too politically correct in not showing the heros or leading actors and actresses in the film having the same feelings and ideas back then during WWII as most people have now which would have come across as phony as a three dollar bill to those people watching the film who lived during those historic and momentous times when the film was to take place
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River near Shasta when this movie was being filmed My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when they filmed Vincent floating down the river A little triviathe scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started his float down the river And if the stunt man missed the netting there was 20 foot waterfall about 14 mile down fartherbr br AnywayI watched it at the time and didnt get it It wasnt until years later when I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it Its pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by Jan at such a young age His movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on TV I wish this movie was available cause I would love to see it again
Just saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years I still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever The innocence and purity of a time now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film The acting is above average and Richard Geres brief appearance as a shell-shocked Raider Marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or Gere fan Jan-Micheal Vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the All-American boy The late Bruno Kirby (who was billed as BKirby Jr) has a meaty role as Pop a peace-loving Marine Corp reject dreaming of getting back home to his wife If youre looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you If youre looking for action and adventure the same applies However if you want to recapture a time in America of innocence honor romance and love then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you
Cheezy? Yep Poorly filmed? You betcha Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters Brilliant anyway (or because of it)? For surebr br This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! br br This is not an all-out spoof like Scary Movie but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun silly sexy and goofy good time!
OK so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted right? Right! Consider yourselves officially warned and read onbr br In this parodytribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980s - a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious Murder McGee who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard As Im sure you can guess things go from bad to worse faster than you can say Wheres the beef?? and in typical 80s horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody the dialogue is cheesy and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get Good timesbr br No clique or 80s horror movie clichéd characterizations are left unrepresented here In fact no stone was left unturned at all  we have the cool hero his innocent girlfriend the Goth chick the tough thug (think John Bender) the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt a couple of gorgeous half-naked lesbians and two big geeksbr br As you can plainly see the cast is pretty big Usually larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel Not in this case though Not a single cast member left me disappointed The acting was very well done Everyone from the cool hero in his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to the grooovy Goth chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett  they all played it straight brought their A-game and knocked it out of the park If youre a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science youll immediately fall in love with the geeksbr br Directorco-writer Jeff C Smith is a guy to watch for in the future trust me on this If this is what he can do with a low budget there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects The characters were dead on; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughs were huge; the blood flowed and squirted and sprayed beautifully  it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980s Call this one THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets NIGHT OF THE DEMONS!!! The tag line says it all and says it honestly - EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE; GRATUITOUS NUDITY; ZERO BUDGET - no false advertising here folks! As fans of this genre we have to look to the indies and support these hard-working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered-down PG-13 horror or pointless remakes like The Hitcher No thank you - no more of that for mebr br In closing I honestly have to say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best indie flicks Ive gotten the pleasure of watching this year Its a bloody good time and holds up on repeat viewings From the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobeeven the closing love theme over the end credits (which if that doesnt bring back fits of laughter recalling mid-80s power ballads by REO Speedwagon - over-pronounced Rs on every word starting with the letter R - then Ill eat my DVD right now)bottom line is if youre a fan of 80s horror or horror in general no more hesitation - this flick deserves to be in your collection!!
Loved this movie! Kicking it old school! Love the idea Love the script Love the characters I really really really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored This was right up with my favs such as Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium If you are a big fan of scary AND silly then this is your movie! Only taken off one star because I would love to have had better sound Not bad sound but would have liked to have more Great blood splatters Great murder weapons Great costumes! I really love the nod to the great 80s teenager stereotype ala breakfast club And I can appreciate the non-CGI suspense Really good camera action and light suspense instead of cutting to CGI I would rather have good fake that really fake fakebr br Kisses to the cast and makers! oh loved the making-of too!
STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films Ive seen in quite some time Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80s horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves the cheesiness preposterous situations wacky and stereotypical characters of 80s horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the pastbr br STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some It has all the excessive violence and gratuitous nudity that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80s horror movies we all love I had a blast watching STMD! From the 80s outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone I just couldnt get enough!
Its the 1980s and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an Ouija board the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one Sound familiar? Its supposed to Its clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80s slashers with the tagline: Excessive violence Gratuitous nudity Zero budget br br Cant get enough; Its pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror clichés but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time There is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80s slasher films though: good acting The entire cast was very talented and you dont see that very much in any low budget flicks recent or otherwise There was a lot of chemistry between the characters I was very entertained throughout the entire film and I am fully convinced the writerdirector and cast will go a long way in their separate careers The script was very well written and the dialogue flowed naturallybr br The effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically NO BUDGET I already know this going in This film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy Although this is not an Oscar award winning opus it never claims to be and props to that Its a lot of fun If you like slashers youll really appreciate this film If you like blood and boobies youll appreciate it also
This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible  Sarahs law  following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne  In fact its scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out hed been fooled by the shows maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-sensebr br If truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud  The edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims  Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile  Cue the childs frightened screams  Like I said very poor taste br br Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs (  No one knows this but its a scientific fact  ) Labour MP Barbara Follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim  Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old Colonel   Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if theyre classed as obscene  The photos included Barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head  a dogs body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to John Holmes  Hey I never said this show was tasteful did I ? br br Its impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians  childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject  The show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but its a biting satire  Perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of Britain before they criticise a mere TV show for exacerbating tensions 
Who ever put that review as of bad taste is not all quite there its so funny genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the seriesall is as good as Morris standards if you think that it is awful distasteful or sick then i can only think of one thing to say to you: go to hell thanks it had to be said! i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete jokei would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that: havent you got anything better to do with your time? what are you trying to prove? thanks for reading my heart-filled review on the mattercheers
Chris Morris Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints both from the audience and from the people taking part But nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this The 2001 Brass Eye Special Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever airedbr br The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program! The subject that the program handled turned many heads but the message was widely misinterpreted The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program This was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia The show was purely about the media and its presentation of the subject Morris is and always will be a media satirist The notion that the program makes fun of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! Morris never attempts to do either such thing He merely draws our attention to the overwhelming and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subjectbr br Using many of his established Brass Eye characters such as Ted Maul and others Morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up and the result is as funny if not funnier than anything Morris has done previously Using his tried and tested formula Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary In actuality they are made to look like exactly what they are Retardsbr br All in all the Brass Eye Special needs to be seen to be believed And with one opening line Morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001: Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!
the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such taboo subjects such as paedophilia the newsdesk set the suits the smug presenters the men-at-the-scene shouting about things you can see behind them the pointless cgi graphs and stats the whole thing was a satire a very very funny satire the way c-list celebritys will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them itll be good for their career (there is no evidence for it but it is scientific fact) It may be hard to watch (with milly dowler and the cambridgeshire girls as well as 911) but satire is supposed to be challenging and we shouldnt be afraid to stand up against the blatant scaremongering and headline grabbing media just because its a delicate matter How this show failed to win any TV awards for its intelligence observation courage acting and thought provocation is shameful but as watching it will show you not in the least bit surprising
Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in Beware My Lovely a 1952 film from RKO Lupino and Ryan did three films together and worked well as a team both being consummate professionals and strong performers In this film based on a Broadway play called The Man Lupino is a World War I widow who rents out a room in her home Shes very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years shes not ready to move on The man who rents her room goes on vacation and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her with some heavy-duty cleaning in the house Hes friendly enough to start but later terrorizes her locking her in the house and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door as he grows violent and more out of touch with realitybr br The character played by Ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house hes working in It isnt clear whether or not hes the killer since he seems surprised to see the body He might be a split personality as when his personality turns ugly toward Lupino he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it He doesnt know that he has the keys to Lupinos house in his pocket and doesnt know why he has tickets to a party that he bought from young children who came to the doorbr br Beware My Lovely is a very suspenseful film and the two leads give terrific performances The tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way youre not expecting
Beware My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to record it and was pleased I didbr br A man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he dont get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widows house but she does not know what she is taking on here It turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer He starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar He then cuts the phones line so she cant get help from the outside A young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isnt quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off Eventually the man leaves acting as if nothing has happenedbr br I can see why Beware My Lovely was given an X certificate when released in the cinemas Some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time I also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy toobr br The cast features an excellent performance from Robert Ryan as the psychopath Ida Lupino as the widow and are joined by Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock as the boybr br This is certainly Robert Ryans most chilling performance Ive seen A must seebr br Rating: 4 stars out of 5
A terrific B-feature A virtual two-hander and set over the course of a day (you can see its stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play) and although only 77 minutes long played out in sequences akin to something like real time Robert Ryan is the psychopath who keeps Ida Lupino trapped in her own home Both are superb especially the under-rated Lupino whose initial independence and self-control soon crumble before Ryans unhinged intruder Today of course it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director Harry Horner (much better known as an Art Director) only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of Hitchcock
I particularly enjoyed Dellys review of this film and agree that Howard is not the only damaged character Howard is rather ruthlessly set-up by the script but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or if she is that he murdered her Howard doesnt know and neither do we In terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there he bolts However he never actually harms Helen Gordon no matter how enraged he is Indeed he reacts with horror at Helens fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissorsthen he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered Helen with the almost pathetic  Im very tired now I think Ill go home Frankly I dont think hes a psychopath A sick puppy certainly but not a psychopathbr br The problem with Howard is that he has no real male identity He wanted to serve his country but his mental condition denies him a place in the army He is singularly rootless and isolated: no wife no girl no home (again at least as far as we know) And he does a womans job - Floors are my speciality Helens niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job Also although he finds himself strongly attracted to Helen he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass He is remarkably powerless - cant fight cant work cant make lovebr br Helen is justifiably terrified however She tries to connect to him but finding that he doesnt respond normally (ie way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose-tinted memories of husband Ned) unwittingly presses all Howards buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escapebr br Both characters trapped in the house trapped by fear neuroses rage and memory deserve sympathy I know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers but I felt it fitted well as it offered a kind of release to the characters Helen is freed I think from the past When Howard tries on her husbands army coat Helens disgusted reaction is highlighted She no doubt feels that the sacredness of Neds possessions has been violated but hopefully her need to keep everything untouched has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger Perhaps she can move onbr br Howard is also freed - from his endless cycle of anger hurt and violence Whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable but I hope its the formerbr br Great performances from Ryan and Lupino I prefer On Dangerous Ground but this is pretty good too
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman She is a war widowbr br The set is limited but the acting makes up for this Robert Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice then confused about where he lives At first Lupino tries to help him He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous But how do we know? The suspense builds I truly enjoy films like this which rely on the human element for suspense What is this man capable of? There are some scenes with OZ Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong We keep thinking she will be helped then Ryans personality turns again He becomes like a JekyllHyde character and eventually chases Lupino with a knifebr br Worth watching for these two superb actors 910
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase He also did a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a couple of years earlier The play Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season It was Dinellis only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone br br The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference Dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so Im wondering what he thought about that Certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the storybr br That wasnt the only thing that was eliminated The people are all wearing period clothing from around World War I yet theres no reference at all to the time this story takes place in I thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to Ida Lupinos residence I noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same erabr br The film is almost entirely set within Ida Lupinos home where shes hired an itinerant stranger in Robert Ryan as a handyman The film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino in her home for about a daybr br Both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made Films like Beware My Lovely are the stuff that a small studio like RKO did best If this were done at MGM or Paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story
We are in a small town a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic and now she is unable to escape her housebr br Beware My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinellis {The Spiral Staircase} story and play called The Man Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness One however shouldnt be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture because it isnt Its clear from the get go that Ryans Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man but this is a different sort of peril movie One that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonistbr br Ryan and Lupino are a great combination they had also done the excellent and far better On Dangerous Ground this same year So with both actors clearly comfortable together it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house re: prison Ryan is particularly strong as his character flits in and out of madness with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy The direction from Harry Horner is safe {he in truth doesnt have to do much other than let his actors run with it} and George E Diskants cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches With one involving Christmas tree baubles immensely memorable Falling some where in between being average and great Beware My Lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow Film-Noir For fans of Robert Ryan tho its something of an essential viewing oh yes and then some 710
When I first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though I saw it again recently I have not changed my mind about it I think it was Robert Ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt (My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and I was impressed
The movie with its single set minimal cast and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TVs early years Nonetheless the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan He wasnt very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful But no one was better at wounded idealism (On Dangerous Ground) or the psychic pain of this movie Few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figurebr br Lupinos problem is that shes locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next The suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape Its a nail-biter all the way This is not one of Lupinos many fine soulful parts that she was so good at Instead its a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough My favorite scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting Ryans already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him Then when Whiting walks in and finds the attractive-looking Ryan scrubbing the floor she starts getting coy flirting with her budding sexuality Sensing trouble Ryan abruptly fends her off-- finesse is not his strong suit Insulted Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work womens work That does it Up to that point hes been courteous and professional with Lupino trying to set himself on a normal path But Whiting has hit his raw nerve Now theres heck to pay as Whiting bounces out the door leaving Lupino to pay the price Its a riveting scene expertly donebr br Anyway this is one of the dozen or so films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black-and-whites in favor of wide-screen spectacles Too bad What a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front She deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much
Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30s40s and 50s you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white Ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures In this film as Mrs Helen GordonHigh Sierra41 along with Robert Ryan(Howard Wilton)Golden Gloves40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor Mrs Gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection If you liked Ida Lupino who could play the roles as a criminal in a womans prison and prison warden who was hated this is the film for you to enjoy I truly believe that Ida Lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the Movie Industry!!!
I can see that the ratings for this film arent all that high for this film so I must be in the minority for liking this film so much Well I am right and everyone else is wrong (just kidding) I guess I like it because I am a psychology teacher and I really liked the brooding character played by Ryan While he truly is dangerous as well as VERY menacing you cant exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma And wow did Ryan do a really good job portraying this man! You really find yourself feeling for Ida Lupino as he destroys her life So with such intense acting and menace why is the movie rated relatively low? Well probably because it isnt exactly believablebut boy is it entertaining and creative Give it a try and dont believe the score of 64--its a lot better than that!
Intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house (Lupino excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant housecleaner (Ryan) The 2 masters of the genre are at their heady erotic best as they match wits emotions and wills in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the Saturday Evening Post Richly hued B & W photography with an unusual amount of close-up head shots The young girl who teases Ryan is really well directed here Improbable but satisfying suburban melodrama
Beware My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man Harry Horner better known for his set designs Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesnt know it Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over to little avail He is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well but one of them cant do well because there is something wrong with him He suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence which he later forgets br br Essentially the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey or in another sense a sadist The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer but it takes Lupino much longer Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to win Ryan over in order to make things work get the job done get on with life But getting on with things isnt in Ryans makeup as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself br br As a study in mental illness the movie isnt too impressive What its superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness with dangerous psychopathology in the mix and its effect on a normal person In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino cant fix Ryan yet we want her to The result is that if one is willing one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside so to speak its melodramatic structurebr br Horner shows us gradually the layout the Lupino house  a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home We become familiar with staircase kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which ones she cant
I first saw this as a kid (THE LITTLE RASCALS first went on TV the year I was born) and fairly recently bought this on DVD In between I watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as a Nubian slave doing voodoo for example I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if theyd tried to do that nowbr br Notice how the pie fights in The Three Stooges HALFWITS HOLIDAY and IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE resemble this oneand this film came out a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures There was obviously some inspiration from SS and Laurel & Hardys THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these filmsremember at that time they all stole from the best each other!!! br br One more note: Laurel & Hardy buffs that bake sale lady was none other than Dorothy Coburn who also appeared in TBOTC-the flapper getting into her car and getting it in the rear end It always escapes me why she was never credited?
Shivering Shakespeare could be considered the first classic of the Our Gang talkie era By now Hal Roach Studios began to hit their stride in making talking pictures and Shakespeare is the happy resultbr br The Gang is appearing in a version of Quo Vadis produced by Kennedy the Cops wife The kids dont find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines Among the funniest bits are Kennedy the Cop as the giant who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume; and the terrible dancing girl (played by director Bob McGowans daughter)br br Several filmographies mention that Shakespeare has the first pie fight in a talkie This may be true seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight Buster Keatons brother Harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies Very funny and an early Gang talkie classic 9 out of 10
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine Id be able to relate to this film perfectly Its pace as well as the dialog churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their headsbr br There are great little elements that pop up through out the film like how Rob Lowes character seems to always be loosing a shoe or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawlessbr br The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness This is one I think most could enjoy A few laugh-out-loud-even-if-you-are-alone moments ensure that Ill certainly be watching this again
This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough The acting and plot arent that impressive but the lines just keep on coming This catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like well a bad movie but its so kooky that you cant help but be amused The spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going I was especially fond of Sharon the Canuck on Shrooms eh? However the one that really stole the show was Richards little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden) his high pitched whining was somehow endearing The whole movie rocked
This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen This in my opinion is Rob Lowe at his best Im not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating I guess you either love it or hate it but if nothing else it is definitely worth a rental
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era but I recommend that all others beware Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough but theres no real pacing or tension in the story I also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying partially due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording I give this a 55100 Most folks will want to steer clear
br br MILD SPOILERS AHEADbr br We Dive at Dawn is an English made movie with John Mills in the lead role The second time I watched the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I must say the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the samll screen May be it was the big screen viewing that helped?br br I still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission the movie takes off too! The search for the German battleship named the Brandenburg and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting!br br Im increasing my rating to 710 If you enjoy WW II films I think youll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway Some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor too!
I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In Which We Serve The scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ships company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s) Some of the throwaway lines are very witty (Im not joining the Band of Hope just to please some greasy fish fryer!) My only complaint is that they didnt show what happened to the Irish coxswain and his bride to be or the tattooed PO and his I Love Arabella tattoo!
If youre in the middle of a ferocious war and its still not clear that youre going to come out on top among the things youll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civiliansto demonstrate that our troops have the bravery the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause And thats just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with 1943s naval war film We Dive at Dawn After more than 60 years its not surprising that some of the movie is dated It doesnt help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring Here as in so many other British war films the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at home in Englands finest ruling-class establishments In this movie Freddie Taylor (John Mills) the captain of the submarine Sea Tiger is clever confident resourceful aggressive in control good with his men humorous with his peers quick to make a decision And it helps that hes lucky His men are jolly tars for the most part competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense Although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while theyre on leave after that things get tense quickly br br Taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg a new German battleship They just miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and heads into the Baltic Taylor assesses the risks and decides the Sea Tiger will go after it through mine fields anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base After several tense situations the confrontation takes place The Sea Tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive not knowing if it had done its job After a clever subterfuge Taylor outfoxes a couple of German destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel He plans to scuttle his sub and surrender when just at the last moment James Hobson (Eric Portman) a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who speaks German says there is a small Danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot He thinks it might still be for the Germans The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain This is a wartime propaganda movie so dont expect failure And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? Youll have to see the movie br br There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies Some like Powells and Pressburgers One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didnt use obvious shorthand clichés Others like We Dive at Dawn were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made Still Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés The Sea Tigers forcing its way through a sub net was tense The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mills no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic inside the sub as well as out as you could hope for and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film but its a well-made well-acted example of its type and time br br John Mills its worth noting had a long long career Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days He had the quality of showing grit cheerfulness and perseverance but of also being trustworthy a man England could be proud of as he fought the war Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold youd want to put on a sweater Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode but Portman manages some complexity for his character Mills and Portman did fine jobs working together on this film
This is an excellent tub-thumper from the war yearsbr br John Mills leads a fine cast of regular British B-movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleshipbr br Filmed in black and white its well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time If anything it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propagandabr br The mission-side of the movie takes place in genuine submarines Things are cramped and claustrophobic The actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate Other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments as well as the engine-room activitiesbr br This probably is the first movie in which debris (and a dead German) is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer And its the ONLY time I have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking - a high risk gamble if ever there was onebr br Im a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire-rope net Submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed and the net would have had a great deal of give Also the engineer was at the same work-station and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged This too seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship - or so Im toldbr br There was a wee bit too much shore-side drama for my tastes But then this was a propaganda effort and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effortbr br These niggles aside its a pretty entertaining little adventure Nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime-time But then; its no longer politically-correct to mention the war in the presence of our European friends (Too many of them have guilty consciences) or our own left-wing fascists (non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted)br br As a submarine movie it is eminently collectible Better than The Enemy Below I think though less demonstrative Not so authentic as Das Boot by any means but not so gross either
Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion respectfully The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War Two and particularly naval warfare I favor depictions of subs and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of things For those unacquainted with target priorities an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing Rank and British-Gaumont studios back in the day: frankly I prefer its quieter more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced Hollywood movie ever could This reminds me of Powell and Pressburgers The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman a favorite of mine John Mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles so this is clearly meant to be Mr Portmans film but the whole cast shines As for the title sequence am I the only one who is utterly charmed by Gainsborough Productions lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl?
The submarine used was NOT Varangian! It was in fact two boats P614 and P615 both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945 br br The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted outbr br There are some extremely realistic moments in the film These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class As no S-class submarines survive the shots of them (as P61) and of the depot ship Forth form part of an interesting record now as well as an excellent film
This movie is all about reality submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science There were no computers giving exact enemy details there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub Not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart and a smile on their dialbr br People with expectations of seeing a pretty war in this movie will be grossly disappointed  GOOD they deserve to be disappointed they deserve to have reality shoved into their facebr br War is not clean exact fought by people about to break into song It is endured by scared coldburnt hungry desperate people willing to do anything to survivebr br We Dive at Dawn is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions
As a teenager I watched this movie every time it was on TV (and it was on a LOT) because of its witty appealing-to-teenager humor It may not be what critics consider 4 star viewing but I love it for what it is--a fun comedy meant to please the audience The teen actors are of my generation (probably why I love the movie so much) and was like a fantasy cast of everyones favorite TV shows of the early 90s--Full House Family Matters Fresh Prince--all of the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90s Though it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen movie writers think vital to success among the youth demographic (or perhaps because of its absence) I highly recommend it to pre-teens and teenagers everywhere
I think this movie is my favorite movie I am not sure why but it is Julia Duffy has been my favorite actress for awhile and when I saw this I went crazy Its sort of romantic and I definitely recommend this movie
This was a excellent back when it came out It had some the best talent available and a funny story Between Candace Cameron and Tatyana Ali it was hard to choose who is cuter and add in Carlton from Fresh Prince and all the other big names and you get a blockbuster Ok a made for TV blockbuster but none the less If you can find this move dont miss itbr br

This is simply a good ole fashioned westernnot overly complex or long It doesnt deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment Still it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Fords Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals Scotts Sheriff Steve Uptons horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving) In Red valley Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta a friend of Cheyennes who gives he and buddy Nitro(Guinn Big Boy Williams)a place to stay for the time being Cheyenne desires to go straight but finds that hard when Jack Lester(Bernard Nedell)and his bad bunch want to rob Red Valleys bank It is actually Jack who is behind the murders but Cheyennes troubled past is hard to get away from He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they didnt commit(the robbery was one Cheyenne didnt commit)and it will be Upton who must somehow save the day before Lester gets away with murder There are sub-plots which include Cheyennes falling in love with Alison McLeod{Evelyn Keyes;the irony of the story is that Alisons father Uncle Willie is actually in cahoots with Banker Stanley Clanton(Porter Hall)in a planned united theft with Lester to steal the town of Red Valleys loot} Will Upton uncover Uncle Willie and Banker Clantons treacherous scheme? Will Uncle Willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him? This film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout Columbia couldnt have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such Dont expect to get your socks blown off but the film is simple and well paced
i liked this western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Fordits got pretty much everything a western should havetheres gunfightsactionchases on horsebacktheres a bit of a romance angle thats hinted attheres some nice comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchananwho plays Uncle Willie McLeoda character who pretend to be a doddering old foolbut is actually aware of everything going onRandolph Scott plays the town Sheriffand Glenn Ford Plays Cheyenne RogersBill Smitha hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his waysi liked the different mix of characters in the moviei didnt find it always fast pacedbut i never found it boring eithereven though the movie is in 1943it is in colour 810
Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once outlaw pals together but now Scotts a sheriff and young Ford is still hiring his gun out He gets hired to pull a bank job but is delayed getting to town and those that hired him get someone else That leads to all kinds of complications a lot for a film thats not even 90 minutes longbr br Randy and Glenn both got girls here Claire Trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls for Ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that Scott is the sheriff inbr br Its B western but unusual for the time and for Columbia Pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment The Desperadoes marked Glenn Fords first film in technicolor a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios Harry Cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it And definitely not during war timebr br The plot gets a bit convoluted as both Ford and Scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediencyduty The plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in Randys town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concernedbr br The four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is Guinn Williams as Fords lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick The climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western filmbr br Fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one
Probably because this is Columbias first film in color the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes They seem to be stronger sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic but very pleasing Randolph Scott is the sheriff a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford who is an outlaw that wants to change Evelyn Keyes is the woman that starts falling for Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess that runs the saloon There is a funny character called Nitro that does not think twice before blowing it I particularly enjoyed two moments of the film one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses there was no computer to help at that time so I presume they must have gathered all those horses no easy task Another moment is the final shootout technically very good There is also quite a fistfight Seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes makes you come to a sad conclusion: They dont make them anymore Would they be able to in case they wanted? I have my doubts
The Desperadoes (1943) is a genuine classic not for its story (which is fairly routine) but for its technical production elements This was a landmark western the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a Columbia production-a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation Only Foxs Jesse James (also starring Randolph Scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre Although it would be eclipsed in a few years by The Searchers and High Noon The Desperadoes was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure br br In 1863 the economy in the town of Red Valley Utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army The script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in Utahs future) and Custers Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements br br Red Valley has an honest sheriff Steve Upton (Scott) but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses The town is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford) a famous outlaw who is an old friend Steves He wants to go straight especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes) Cheyennes partner Nitro Rankin (Guinn Big Boy Williams) is mainly there for comic relief as are Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the town judge (Raymond Walburn who models his character on Frank Morgans Wizard of Oz crystal ball faker) br br Taking no chances with their huge budget Columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but Indians and covered wagons There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed a spectacular barroom brawl an explosive climax romance and three-strip Technicolor All this stuff doesnt necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943 Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy br br The cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming The indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences br br Scott and Claire Trevor were top billed but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford who would soon be their biggest star And Director Charles Vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarletts sister in Gone With the Wind had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films) br br The Ford-Keyes dynamic is The Desperadoes most unique and important feature Rather than go for the cliché love triangle with Scott andor Trevor (which it first appears will happen) the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors This was probably the best role Keyes ever got and she makes the most of it Playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightleys character in Pirates of the Caribbean This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the WAAC for WWII military service br br The Desperadoes is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD br br Then again what do I know? Im only a child
This movie was very good I really enjoyed it Tom McCamus performance was excellent and very believable as the consumptive son Edmund I also enjoyed the set design (house) and the costumes
This is a great movie The best role Peter Strauss ever did The music is good the message harsh the actors great and the story is both emotional and raw Only in the seventies did they make them like this one!
I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature Finally!!!!! Its about time Hollywood got their act together The big Studios always frown at edgy material with Oscar written all over it Go figure!!br br JERICHO MILE was made ahead of its time Its a masterpiecebr br Michael Mann a true visionary found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence Peter Strauss Emmy award performance is probably the best character role Ive seen in my film-viewing lifetime Any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless an Academy Award is already sitting on their mantle)br br The gritty multi ethnic ensemble a backdrop for THE JERICHO MILE makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world This is about redemption without public validation and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers Imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole that doesnt know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world what would you do??br br This movie makes you walk away feeling you havent been cheated on any level Totally thrilling engaging emotional and a Rolling Stones soundtrack that kicks ass!!!br br I always thought this would be made for the big screen Cant wait!!! In the meantime Ill have to continue re-watching my weathered VHS copy Ive had for many years
The first time I saw this film I was a kid I was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters I saw it on Network TV I remember watching it aloneand crying afterward It was only the second film to illicit that response (Rocky was the first) and there havent been many since I cant say why exactly; Larry Rain Murphy didnt deserve to win any more that Rocky Balboa or anyone else I know I admired Murphy not so much for what he did but for the way he did his time Stoic He didnt need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity He ran because he could He needed no other reason I have a rule today that when I see this film late at night on cable television (the only time most will come across it) I must watch no matter what I have to do the next morning Fortunately it doesnt play often like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites so I still get plenty of sleep and I never tire of the story of one mans unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory
A film that deserved theatrical release This made-for-television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of Michael Mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images Always with Mr Mann the amplification of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy-award-winning actor added to the ensemble of cast writer director and cinematographerbr br This film is definitely one of my all time favorites While nothing is perfect this film comes very very closebr br Along with an excellent script great direction and masterful acting by Richard Strauss there is an all-star ensemble of character actors at their finest: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush You may not recognize the names but you will recognize every facebr br If this comes on TV sit down with popcorn turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film I highly recommend recording it since it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and the DVD is region 2 encoded
i love watching the Jericho mile i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter i think peter Strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing no man alive can out race rain Murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him ive watched the Jericho mile 100s of times and will watch it 100s more great movies get watched more than movies that are not i thank the makers of this film for giving years of there lives to make itthey are great people and i bless them allthank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all
Peter Strauss by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - Usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film having channel-hopped into it half-way through Well Ive just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film!!br br Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much br br Looking to be objective I attempted to criticise this film Instead I found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit-picks This is what true realistic film-making is about This is not your typical Hollywood sensationalism where everything is overacted - Its so realistic and true to life that people have thought its based on a real event!!
I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (Im not sure why -- Im sure some shrink could make something out of it!) I spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago and I knew then I would never go back - I got the individual version of scared straight! (I did get locked up in an isolation cell on Alcatraz for a couple of hours compliments of a park ranger but thats another story!) Anyway the genre really interests me The soundtrack specifically Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones was the perfect backdrop for the film To this day I think of The Jericho Mile every time I hear the song
An interesting and involved film about a lifer just trying to live out his days peacefully Elements of the main character appear in Michael Manns later films like Thief (1981) Heat (1995) and so on You can see this one at the UCLA Instructional Media Laboratory-- one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public Its a great one!
Ive never given a movie a ten out of ten before but this is the closest I have ever come (I gave it a 9) There are very few movies that I truly love this however is one of them With its gritty realism fantastic on-site locationing and its great soundtrack it literally blew my young mind when I first saw it in 1979 At that point I didnt know about prisons violence racial tensions or the struggle to survive & live free I doubt that anyone who is an adult or for that matter anyone who is growing up in todays world could be impacted by this film in the same way I was all those years ago but I will say this: if you havent seen this movie I envy you; this is because you have the chance to see this great film for the frist time For each of us theyre different but heres to the rarest movies of them all: the ones we actually love
I watched the this the other night on a local station because I didnt feel like watching tripe like American Idol Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named Rain Murphy who keeps to himself He admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it His cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures The only time he feels in another zone is in running He does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes When a college coach hears about this he wants to prime him for a shot at the Olympics At first Rain wants no part of this but when his best friend is killed he shows interestbr br This is a good movie period Strauss is very good (What did you expect anything less?) and Michael Mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later This movie had that bit of realism (probably because it was filmed among convicts) It almost feels like this was a true story The additional casting is good There is a lot of notable names like Brian Dennehy Roger E Mosley and Richard Moll as wellbr br My heart sank when some pompous board of directors wouldnt let him run because he didnt feel bad for his crime His final act made me stand up and cheer When they took his dreams away he took them back hard This was back when TV movies were actually good The Jericho Mile is a gem of a film ESPN Classic PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM!!!
I watch a lot of movies - DVD features and classics you name it The night I watched JERICHO MILE my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school that it had stayed with her all of these years Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter & son) and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles We all were br br She who remembered the original and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldnt believe it Our favorite scene? Bar none when peter Strauss so passionately bangs his fist down and says id do it AGAIN! It didnt advocate violence because it was a defense crime but evoked such intensity we couldnt believe itwhen his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts there wasnt a dry eye in our housebr br Someone please make more movies like this one UNBELIEVABLE!!
The film is not for everyone Some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural There are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments There is a lot of indecision an lot of conflicting feelingsbr br Actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject Sex with minors It is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing Complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with minors and complex because the characters dont know if society is right or if their instincts are rightbr br Some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions Questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship who was damaged did good come out of it was it art who was damaged more did some of the problems with their relationship stem from it being forbidden by society did some of the problems stem from their own immaturity and probably most important was this truly a crime?br br The film is resolutely neutral on all of this and it is this neutrality that is its strength It is the reason for the understated acting the simple sets the lack of background music soft lighting and the general flat presentation The message is clear We dont really understand this kind of relationship today and quick judgments are bound to be shallow
Jennifer Montgomerys Art for Teachers of Children is a stunning disturbing masterpiece Montgomerys gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifers seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifers mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful Ive ever seen captured on film The lesson ultimately learned here? Theres nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art Well I would highly recommend this remarkable piece of Art for anyone interested in thought-provoking independent cinema
To summerize this movie: nice for TV but too small for the theatre I enjoyed watching this movie at home but I wont watch it a second time The concept is good but what ends up in the movie is just a summary The end had a nice twist but is still unsatisfying Maybe it was the intention of the director but it wasnt worked out like a it should be But then again its an OK kind of movie
If you enjoy riddles and suspense you will enjoy this movie Truth be told it was mostly the Adrian Paul part that got me to pick it up I knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope) a student of philosophy and metaphysics starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out the reason and gets involved in the game by solving riddles Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner also a riddle fanatic and also gets entangled in the game Myth has it that if you solve the game the meaning of existence (referred to as The Design) is revealed Brendan Fehrs character is a village idiot type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than he seems All in all I thought the movie was pretty well done And its definitely an original concept a rare find these days! I personally happen to like riddles and puns so while most of them werent very difficult it was still a fun movie Well worth the rentalbr br  So if you havent seen it -- get it! :-Dbr br 
This is a cult classic for sure!!br br It is tricky to follow at times but then again so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club If you want standard fare then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic But if you want  to view the world differently then i would say open yourself up to Enigmas and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and thinkbr br For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout So while i have seen some complaints all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy
I watched this film not knowing anything about it I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort How wrong I was The plot is enthralling and intelligent the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change Some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple I am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as I thought it was quite unusual If you liked the film Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix then you will like this There is no major special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all It is all about the plot about building the characters and building an atmosphere It is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may irk some people but I thought the ending was great I am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark  mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman ( Vern and Sarah )  each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past  Fine dialogue and first-rate casting propel this low key noirish journey into the girls search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life Aided by her  anything but enthusiastic male friend the two of them reach the end of their quest  but with a price to be paid The film never intends to answer all of its mysteries  but does an excellent job in the exposition of several plot twists
I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind The trauma the suspense is just amazing I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it and relating it to reality Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you dont forget those that make you doubt your reality A problem could be the quality but that doesnt bring down the essence of the moviebr br The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer I just totally loved it! So many clues and twitches and puzzles One of the best movies ever hands down
this film was probably the best scary film ive seen in years chilling might be a more accurate description the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept since noone truly knows that answer you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry the rest of the cast were somewhat shaky however since the focus was on sara novak (carly pope) her performance anchored the movie the at times poor acting abilities of her costars were not an issue since it was not their performances that fuelled this movie (thankfully) watch this movie you should enjoy itbr br t
What can I say? Not as bad as many here have made it out to be The only reason I even watched this film that I had previously never heard of before was strictly for IAN McSHANEbr br I was not disappointed in the least IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role Hes always great to watch and for my money an extremely underused actorbr br As for the rest of the film Every other actor in the movie delivered strong solid performances These people certainly werent being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a fairly low budget film) but this did not mean that any of them mailed their appearances in Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to thembr br I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAULs performance though I must admit I have only ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this moviebr br The plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film Anybody who expected a clear-cut by-the-numbers connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie CLEARLY wasnt watching the film closely enough! This film is not going to tell you what the meaning of life is! The idea is that after seeing the film you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee I certainly didbr br No car chases No explosions No bar room brawls (sounds pretty dull huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by the film and its just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involvedbr br  WARNING If youre the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous question as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directlybr br YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS FILM
A raw edgy thriller that aimed for great philosophical heights it couldnt quite attain I did still enjoy the film immensely It had great elements of suspense leaving me with that delightful spine chill I expect from thrillers and it achieved this purely psychologically without resorting to escalating blood and gore The soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly At times it was a bit unpolished particularly the acting and character development It could only have been a better film if we had known more about the nightmares from the past the characters see when they close their eyes and why they felt this desperate need to seek the answer that is so integral to the storyline After all they seemed to continue to seek it despite knowing or at least having an inkling of what might happen when they found it I would recommend seeing this film if you are prepared to look beyond the grit to see the potential of a diamond in the rough
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school I thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles I think the type of people that wouldnt like this movie would be those who dont like solving things or those who get frustrated when they cant solve riddles its a good movie based on a true story that happened in my home town of Toronto Ontario so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there watch this movie And for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws realize that in real life this same stuff does happen but thats all I want to say on that The riddles are good some are hard some are not But the movie also leaves you wanting more more riddles more explanation just plainly more Something more I want to add is that the ideas within this movie the underground riddle world does exist but there is a lot more to it To find it you can not look for it To never look for it would be no way to find it Leave your mark and it will find you
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you dont have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching) but I think that is totally missing the point If your expecting fast cars T&A or a movie that will spell itself out for you then dont watch this youll be disappointed and dumbfoundedbr br This movie was thoroughly enjoyable kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think The writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end just remember to keep an open mindbr br Note: the school scenes were all filmed at McMaster University and most of the rest was done in Toronto
Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles death mystery and philosophy In its simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when youve finally found them all The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth yet Sarah is so close to understanding it all What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?br br The movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn While this was Warns first feature length film the movie doesnt reflect that at all but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch I would definitely love to see more of her workbr br Being based on riddles this is a very cerebral movie Its thats your thing as it is mine then I totally recommend seeing Nemesis Game Rating: 455
As a late-going patron of the drive-in thearers (1970s-1980s) there are many movies that I have seen & forgotten This is one I could never forget Despite its low-budget exploitation-style of movie-making the STORY was very well done The isolated therapy-asylum where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their phsycosis the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene the (supposed) assistant doctor taking over the various crazy paitents the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself and finally the rescue of the young nurse by the simple-minded Sam who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape unharmed made for a great STORY which held the film together I emphasised the word STORY because thats what makes a good or great film No matter how much blood gore nudity sexual matter or outrageous behaviour you put in a film if the STORY is not good then the film is not good The film credits show clips of all the actors including the old hag with the final line telling you to get out & never come back which is a great ending to this film If it is out on videoDVD see it & enjoy it
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by Dr Geraldine S Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick) Among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the luscious Betty Chandler) loopy Judge Oliver W Cameron (a gloriously hammy Gene Ross) paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin) gentle giant Sam (the amiable William Bill McGhee) and nutty old hag Mrs Callingham (the supremely irritating Rhea MacAdams) Said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by Dr Masters which of course results in a rash of brutal killings Director SF Brownrigg working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by Tim Pope does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocatingly dank and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia Robert Farrars spooky score the grimy set design a few wild grisly murders Bruce B Alcotts grungy no-frills cinematography plenty of deliciously robust scenery-scarfing histrionics from a game no-name cast (Ross in particular is a total eye-rolling hoot) and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall infectiously seedy fun of this choice trashy chunk of 70s low-budget regional horror exploitation cinema
This film also known as dont look in the basement is actually not bad It is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but I found this movie pretty entertaining Dont get me wrong its certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me I thought the acting  which seemed forced at first somehow got better as the film went along It seems like the actors really got into their roles There are some good colorful characters including a guy who thinks hes still a soldier one who thinks hes a judge an adult with a childs brain and an attractive girl who craves attention so bad she drops her clothes when any man gets near her The title dont look in the basement has about as much relevance to the story as the last house on the left has on that film If you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like I do check this out
Dont Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting Sure its not a masterpiece by anyones standards but it is a very fun little B-film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your headbr br As I said the acting could have been a lot better but thats the case with most exploitation so I cant really complain The story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing I thought the gore was a lot of fun too Theres just something great about older gore films because they didnt have CGI back then so they had to actually set it all up themselves See this one for a good time!
I just discovered this obscure 70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube For a low-budget effort it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish While there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly the fact that shes a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and theres one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad The young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and Im not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy Some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous For the most part however Dont Look in the Basement (Thats the title I saw on YouTube) provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining B-movie
Clearly my rating for this is not to suggest it compares with the classy horrors of the likes of Argento but with other 70s low budget drive in fare and in that department it truly is a classic The lack of money shows (Does anyone care too much?) the acting is adequate rather than professional (Does that make it more realistic?) but unlike so many other movies and not just low budget ones this does not drag for a moment Crap it may be but non stop crap in your face crap and although inevitably a bit campy at times this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what Im talking about At times quite delirious this crazy little film filled out with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun indeed it is to watch
Widely known as Dont Look in the Basement - this is pure 70s horror B-movie goodness that could actually pass as the genres version of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest Though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour+ of its runtime I enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies - such as the former army sergeant a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll a lovable man-child and a loony nymph After their head-doctor is murdered by a patient a small sanitarium hires a new nurse onto their under-staffed facility who becomes immersed in the residents different ticks and outbursts Things gradually become stranger however when patients start acting far more abnormal than usual You never really know or care where the movie is going cause it still entertains up until its completely whacked-out ending! Several of the twists felt a little too forced and I could have used a tad more blood but I really dug this much too under-rated blend of humor and horror Check it out
Back in the 70s a small-time Texas filmmaker named SF Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years Before viewing his first film Dont Look In The Basement I wasnt too sure what to expect but I sure as hell didnt expect it to turn out to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre I dont know this might actually be my all-time favorite horror moviebr br We begin in an isolated insane asylum At first it seems like a rather laid-back place to get mentally healthy considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot as if it were their house (I guess it is) none of them seem all that dangerous only delusional The residents include a love-nympho a 700 year old woman a man-child a spaz a guy who thinks hes in a war a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks hes a judge One day out of nowhere Judge kills the doctor with an axe shortly thereafter the wanna-be baby mama kills the nurse Ten minutes into the movie and things are looking really ugly Perhaps the new nurse will know what to do then again perhaps not Giving away more would do more harm than good Its best to plunge head first into this one knowing as little as possible If you can appreciate honest-to-God untampered with horror then you will not be disappointed br br If you liked Scream if you liked Wrong Turn if you go for that unoriginal over-produced over-scored digital Hollywood garbage then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one Dont Look In The Basement being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking The atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove Unfortunately good ol SF used up most of his good ideas on his first movie although the next entry in his Texas-sized quadrilogy is somewhat of a masterpiece that is if youre into extra sleazy mean-spirited Hixploitation like someone I know If you fall in love with Brownriggs first two and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer check out Dont Open The Door and The House Where Hell Froze Over Dont Look in The Basement has everything that successful horror needs no stars no budget no digital effects just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum with a dozen cast members and a somber subtle score and of course the twist This is real horror for the real horror fan 1010
Although it isnt mentioned very often Dont Look in the Basement is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch The story follows a young nurse Charlotte Beale who is hired at Stephens Sanitarium to replace Dr Stephens after he is murdered by a patient Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale and her boss Dr Geraldine Masters acts as if shes hiding somethingbr br This movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about and have sympathy for during the climax which doesnt happen very often in horror films The musical score is great and is reminiscent of Dark Shadows the performance from Rosie Holotik Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee are all great the story is very intriguing with a great twist ending This movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other film I have ever seen has been able to capture Many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic Dont Look in the Basement is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive-in films
A nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by Doctor Stephens She is upset to learn that the doctor has diedleaving his assistant Doctor Masters in chargeShe is unnerved by the inmates including a crazy Judgea shell-shocked Vietnam veta catatonic and a creepy nymphobut is soon befriended by a hulking black man SamShe needs all the friends she can get as people are dying all around herDont Look in the Basement is my first horror film of SF BrownriggDespite its low-budget it manages to provide some genuine chills plus a nice amount of cheap gore including a particularly nasty scene with a desk-spindle through an eyeballThe climax of inmates taking control over mental asylum is an intense melange of wild camera-workgore and piercing screams8 out of 10
Dr Stephens (Michael Harvey) head of a seriously understaffed institute for the insane takes a progressive approach towards the treatment of his patients even allowing his loonies complete freedom of the building day and night; he pays the price for his forward thinking however when he rather stupidly prescribes chopping wood with an axe as therapy for one of his patients and consequently gets his neck mistaken for a log (serves him right for not suggesting basket weaving)br br Shortly after this tragic incident nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to take up position as the doctors assistant and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much sterner Dr Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick) Despite being unaware of her deceased predecessors decision to employ Ms Beale and not particularly eager to take on new staff Dr Masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work but following several harrowing experiences at the hospital Charlotte begins to wonder whether it might have been better if she had been turned awaybr br It doesnt take a genius to figure out what is actually happening at the hospital the lunatics have taken over the asylum schtick being a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans but SF Brownriggs Dont Look In The Basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive-in fun thanks to its well defined collection of nutters: lobotomised popsicle-sucking Sam (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W Cameron (Gene Ross) who continuously mumbles courtroom phrases; old Mrs Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) who recites William Allinghams creepy poem The Fairies and warns Charlotte of impending doom; cackling loon Danny (Jessie Kirby) who delights in teasing the other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr) who thinks her doll is a real baby; army nut Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all Allyson King (Betty Chandler) whose rejection by a series of men has left her with a craving for love (ie she tries to jump any man who goes near her)br br This convincingly crazy set of characters plus a bit of gore and nudity reasonable direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us the impressive white trash horror Scum of the Earth) and a solid turn from Playboy covergirl Holotik all go to turn an otherwise rather predictable low budget piece of exploitation into a very watchable psycho shocker
Im not sure what intrigues me about this movie so It is grainy poorly written bleached out often ridiculous and at many points mind numbingly dull (the person I was watching it with fell asleep twice) And yet there is something in this film that fascinates me though I am not sure what; perhaps the character of Sam an enormous former patient who was lobotimized by the former head doctor and who is perpetually sucking on an ice pop) or the marvelously played head doctor (I forget her name)br br Anyway watch it and form youre own opinion; it has one of the greatest endings I have seen in film
Young ambitious nurse Ms Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere During the course of 3 days she encounters strange happenings even a patient in her bedroom watching her yet she still stays The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (espically by the Judge) but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams) The storyline is okay at best and the acting is surprisingly alright but after awhile its gets to be a little much But still its fun quirky strange and originalbr br Note: The thing inside the basement is hardly horrifying so the title is a little bananas
Dont Look In the Basement is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horrors real underground stars and IMHO is vastly overdue some proper recognition Dont is his undisputed masterpiece This scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd disjointed claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on It succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty just plain grubby for Brownriggs world is this mad unwashed scummy prison cell of rants obsessions and all shades of mental illness And he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grot blanket around you like a bad memory There is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing In a word classic Also if you watch Dont first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks Brownriggs other films In summary they really dont come any more esoteric than this - well actually they do track down Brownriggs Keep My Grave Open Mad genius Accept no substitute
 but you probably have seen it or else you wouldnt be here Its so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like I did because this little known gem receives no word-of-mouthbr br From the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but Dont Look in the Basement plays it subtle which makes for superior suspense Note to horror filmmakers: some of us do like subtlety! Lovely and homely nurse Charlotte takes a job at a sanitarium but is dismayed when she learns that the head doctor who hired her had a gruesome accident and she is now the subordinate to a mysterious doctor who we all know isnt a doctor at all The suspense is built through Charlottes unraveling of events with assistance from many of the patients but which of the patients can Charlotte trust? This is a gem and is my absolute favorite TRUE HORROR movie I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead but they play more for the HORROR-COMEDY crowdbr br VIOLENCE: $$$ (Quite tame for horror standards but there is a decent sprinkling of gore throughout the film The opening scene is classic; no other horror film starts out better and the end has its fair share of gore as well)br br NUDITY: $$$$ (Eager to fall in love Allyson (Betty Chandler) spends a good deal of time naked attempting to seduce half the men at the sanitarium Betty Chandler is a knockout and I am shocked that this is her only film credit)br br STORY: $$$$ (The story is well handled despite the premise getting a lot of mileage in Hollywood The script has a knack for building suspense and never fails to place poor Charlotte in a precarious situation)br br ACTING: $$$$ (Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson capturing dementia with naiveté in an ethereal form The Judge was splendid as well weighing facts before he came to a verdict while Rosie Holotik as Charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for her character
DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties List The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic The main character although way hotter than most low budget starlets is a pretty standard low budget lead The Doctor Masters character is well written and well acted Some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie Its Campy I aint trying to lie The character that makes this great is a Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-mad-flick The gore is pretty standard although I think the color of the blood is awesome Its so Red This movie I believe was received poorly because of it advertising scheme Some soulless little ad executive got his grubby hands on it and thought  Lets rip of the AD campaign for Last House on the Left thats doing well Little chumps like this have ruined the world of film All balls and no brain Also the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic Maybe there all drunk Youll see what I mean One more little note Dont buy this from the Wally-Mart dollar rack They have cut it to and unwatchable level Try to find the longest cut you can
Yet another in the long line of Dont films of the late 70s and early 80s yet this one is much more than that This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but its the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actorsactresses that make this movie good A young nurse arrives at Dr Stephens progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be It seems Dr Masters a rather ambitious female doctor has taken over his duties and begun to implement her own ideas Each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions There is the nymphomaniac the crazy old crone the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants and a man who has reverted back to his childhood among others There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies piling up If you are a fan of cheap 70s sleaze than this is the film for you!
The impossibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale a new nurse at one of those movie-type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own unorthodox ways of treating the inmates Reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious Dr Masters (Anne MacAdams aka Annabelle Weenick) The inmates dont take too kindly to Charlotte eitherbr br Part mystery part horror this initial effort from B-movie director SF Brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it These colorful psychos including a nymphomaniac with no self-esteem a gentle giant whos already had a lobotomy and a supposed judge who speaks in legalese jargon dominate the screen with their unnerving presencebr br Its a picture that works fairly well establishing the gritty grim atmosphere right from the get go Some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative qualitybr br It builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity offering one surreal encounter after another Particularly effective is the poetry-quoting dotty old Mrs Callinghambr br For cheap 1970s era cheese its pretty effective with a particularly nasty climax I had a pretty good time watching itbr br 710
I found the film Dont Look In The Basement to be very good with some great characters in it It is about a young psychiatric nurse called Nurse Charlotte Beale(Rosie Holotik)who is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum Whilst there she meets various sorts of different characters including Dr Geraldine Masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital Dr Stephens gets killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an axebr br My favourite characters in the film are Mrs Challingham(Reah MacAdams) a very funny little old lady Allison who is a nymphomaniac and Sam(Bill McGhee) a young black guy who goes around all Day seeming to be in a world of his own all of the time The film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film I know that it was on the Video Nasties list back in the 80s but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it Alothough it did have some disturbing senses in it GREAT FILM RECOMMENDED!!!
I personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in hospitals and asylums so I had a good feeling about watching this Dont Look in the Basement even though its reputation is doubtful Well turned out I was right! This is great trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters You have to of course look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but if you manage to do that (and if youre a fan of this type of horror thats an essential quality) youll be rewarded with an outrageous video-nasty in which blood and insanity form the main elements The young and cute nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where shes supposed to start her new job She finds out that the Doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctor-in-charge Masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival The life inside the sanitarium is rather peculiar with the patients running around free and every door is kept unlocked After a whole series of bizarre events Charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides The opening 10 minutes (pre-credits) are great and so is the completely deranged climax Everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you patiently wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun The asylums patients are textbook lunatics but I love them nevertheless Some of my favorites include the former judge (who still talks exclusively in legal terms) the suspicious army-Sargeant and the mad-raving old lady Dont Look in the Basement is great low-brained fun especially recommended to fans of 70s trash-cinema sick puppies and other types of scum The lunatics have taken over the asylum yeah!!
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre Vulnerable naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her br br The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style as well as a cast of wacky characters The pleasures of this film dont come from the films shocks which are fairly tame but from the weird atmosphere First we have the delusional woman who thinks her baby doll is real Theres also an axe-murdering judge a shell-shocked war veteran and old Mrs Callahan is like everybodys daffy elderly grandmother gone amok A young patient named Allyson gives the term nymphomaniac new meaning A big guy named Sam is just a little slow after a botched lobotomy and Jennifer vaults suddenly between catatonia and violent outbursts The only other sentient person in the place seems to be Dr Masters but does she have a secret?br br Dont Look in the Basement is a great example of low-budget exploitation films There isnt much plot going on but the cheapness works for the movie Several cast members turn in memorable performances particularly Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick and the way the director adds little weird details to the movie can really stick with youbr br The scene between Allyson and the telephone man is a classic for all time and especially delicious are the facial expressions of Dr Masters when she begins to go over the edge near the finale of the movie Brownrigg also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack with several musical cues really evoking the characters that they accompany My favorite cue is the crazy cue a sitar that twangs whenever one of the patients does something pathologicalbr br Also wonderful is the way that Charlotte herself plunges into hysteria at the climax with the patients revealing that Dr Masters is simply another inmate and then suggesting that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is being allowed to act out her delusions (she certainly has a tenuous grip on reality why else would she not question the ominous lack of phone service or outside contact?) The scene where Charlotte manages to finish off the barely-alive Dr Stephens with a toy boat has to be one of the greatest moments in low-budget horror Yes Dont Look in the Basement could very well be the American Beauty of Grade Z trash
This is such a fun and funny movie Highly entertaining at all angles It features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts We got; the judge the Sargent the kid the creepy old lady the slut the clown And unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesnt have any locks and is understaffed So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous We also learn a lesson along the way never give your patient an ax! br br This was before Cukkos Nest AND surpasses it At least on the fun level It even has its sweet moments Love is pure Love is grace Love is strength You love me your love is pure youll always love me Now who could resist that? Nuts are humans too Just a few loose wires Be a little careful or youll get an ax in the back! Children at play Hehebr br The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine All the characters in this film are tremendously well played And I really did find them funny No HILARIOUS! They may even give you dirty thoughts of how you can take advantage of them Or how they can take advantage of youbr br This is actually a very smart movie There is a brilliant twist ending I must say I expected this to be a good but never expected THIS It is horrific The court has made its decision You are no longer in control! I love it The ending is so SO perfect youll shed a tearbr br I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this I will never forget it now It is not just a cult it is a cult CLASSIC Whatever you do Dont Look In The Basement !!!
Nurse Charlotte Beale(the lovely Rosie Holotik)has arrived to Dr Stephens clinic for the insane prepared for a new job What she doesnt expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal judge Oliver W Cameron(in a running gag anytime he confronts a situation out of his control he retreats to repeating his name) That doctor is Geraldine Masters(Annabelle Weenick)who isnt sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment After a long discussion about the position(which is quite an awkward scene as the two debate about Beales being sent a letter by Stephens getting a job at the clinic with Masters often reminding her that he is no longer in charge)Masters agrees to let her work in the nursing position but the good Doctor may not be who she seemsbr br The assortment of loonies includes Sam(Bill McGee)a simple-minded child-man who was Stephens last victim of lobotomy Jennifer(Harryette Warren)a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she wallows at Masters heel like a puppy Danny(Jessie Kirby)a trouble-making annoyance often trying to steal the fake baby of disturbed Harriet(Camilla Carr) Allyson(Betty Chandler)a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and hops at any man she sees & Sergeant Jaffee(Hugh Feagin)your typical case of soldier who hasnt escaped the madness of warbr br The film shows Masters unorthodox methods of running the clinic with allowing the patients to roam free with the doors to all rooms without locks calling into questionand not to mention the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite just chopping Dr Stephens with an axe And what exactly happened to Dr Stephens? Ah habr br Tacky 70s drive-in trash is a lot of fun if you are into a warped brand of cinema Im attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejects because of their unpredictable natureyou just never know what the hell might happen especially in this case where they are allowed to roam often unattended Some consider the low budget a liability but in the case of this film I think it enhances the experience With the cheap photography and weak production values(being shot for peanuts in a run down house in some awful location)it seems creepier and I felt like a voyeur peering into insanity through a camera lens on the outside looking in
If anyone ever assembles a compendium on modern American horror that is truly worth its salt there will have to be an entry for SF Brownriggs ubiquetous exercize in Asylum Horror Every time I watch this movie I am impressed by the complete economy of the film from the compact totally self-contained plot with a puzzling beginning and an all too horrible ending the engaging performances by what was essentially a group of non-professional actors and a prevading sense of dread and claustrophobia that effectively consumes the narrarive with a certain inevitability which is all the more terrifying because the viewers know what is going on long before the hero[es] with the only question being when are they going to wake up & smell the coffee?br br Shot on a dental floss budget in Brownriggs native Texas at an old palatial manor that nicely serves as the setting for a private sanitorium DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is another intriguing twist on the good old Edgar Allan Poe tome about inmates taking over the asylum just before an otherwise normal outsider unwittingly joins the ranks without realizing until it is far too late that not all is what it seems they are totally cut off & beyond any outside help and inevitably find their own sanity questioned as the madness spins out of control -- The Original STAR TREK TV series had a go at this with their WHOM GODS DESTROY episode from 1968 Juan Moctezuma gave the proceedings a peyote fueled Mexican psychedelic trip in DR TARRS TORTURE DUNGEON in 1972 and tangentially related is Fernando Di Leos ASYLUM EROTICASLAUGHTER HOTEL which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an ending that can only be defined as Splatter Cinema -- Brownrigg may not have seen or been thinking of SLAUGHTER HOTEL but he sure came up with some similar ideasbr br Legaliciuos former Playboy Playmate Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale RN in Clinical Psychology who has just left her nice job as a supervisor at a major hospital to travel way out into the middle of some god forsaken waste right out of a Peckinpah movie to work with a Dr Stevens at his private sanitorium Dr Stevens has pioneered a new form of therapy based upon basically encouraging the emotionally & psychologically scarred to face their inner obsessions bring them to the surface and hopefully rid the patients of whatever has fried their sense of reasoning Nice idea but arming a 6ft 250 pound utterly insane man with an axe and telling him to pound out his aggression AND THEN TURNING YOUR BACK ON HIM probably isnt the smartest idea and Dr Stevens is dispatched before Ms Holotik even appears onscreen with a good whack to the lower portion of his skullbr br This event leaves the sanitorium effectively in the hands of one Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Weenick who also served as the script supervisor & production manager] a woman of startlingly professional demeanor who quickly defuses the situation with the help of Sam the films wonderfully unlikely hero a lobotomized African American boheomouth played by an actor named Bill McGhee who was sadly robbed of a supporting Oscar nomination for his turn as a mass of muscle with the brain of an 8 year old boy Sams one wish is to have someone help him put his prized toy boat in the water and his continual asking of the various female cast members to do so [and his nonstop consumption of chocolate popsicles] as SOME kind of underlying theme though we will avoid such here because the kids might still be up There is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients but Ill leave the details of that to your discoverybr br Ms Holotik arrives just as Dr Stevens has been effectively laid to rest and is quickly won over by the snappy professionalism of Ms Masters who reluctantly allows the leggy young nurse to stay on in spite of the tragedy that has just happened oh TWENTY MINUTES AGO which you must admit was rather sporting of her Holotiks Nurse Beale begins to demonstrate symptoms of not being the sharpest meat cleaver in the drawer however when informed that she shares living quarters with a bunch of maniacs and there are no locks on the doors & doesnt trudge off for the nearest Ace Hardware Store to pick up a hasp and padlock to secure herself and we are treated to a couple of truly creepy scenes where some of the inmates sneak into her room & do stuff like smell her hair try to kill her with butcher knives and caress her neck with axe heads But thats all a part of working in such a radical psychiatric health care environment Ms Masters informs her and she goes about her oddly defined rounds that consist of wearing as leg defining a nurse outfit as you can find in a 42nd Street fetish boutique and getting to know the inmatesbr br Allysson is a obsessive compulsive nymphomaniac with homicidal tendancies who likes to take off her shirt & provide the film with some T & A between fits of histrionics;

Jennifer is a Phish fan who couldnt score a ticket to the New Years Eve Show and went insane & likes to scarf down nembutols and other barbituates when nobody is looking and likewise has hidden homicidal tendancies linked to her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron is apparently a homicidal pervert who became obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to chop things up with axes; Ms Callingham is an aged poet who serves as a sort of soothsaying old hag from MACBETH before the cat gets her tongue; and Danny is an insane idiot who was included in the cast as the random element that the plot cannot control and whos antics serve as the real catalyst for the series of tragedies & murders that ultimately take place in this dark old creepy house in the middle of nowherebr br The house itself is a wonderful set with a threadbare early 1970s decor that is remarkable in its unremarkableness with a fantastic use of color achieved by subtle ambient lighting The house is a series of hallways and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors twisting confined stairways secreted closets and passageways leading to the different larger areas and of course the basement mentioned in the title -- visited only once but boy it sure proves to be a doozy! I love the frosted old freezer where Sam keeps his stash of popsicles the utterly plain exteriors that remind me of a summer home our family used to visit every year & force us to swelter in the heat: Everyone is covered with beads of persperation and looks exhausted and even the ever cheerful Sam at one point begins to suspect that bad things are happening though he cannot understand what it all means and Rosie H is too firm in her belief of her profession to even suspect what has really happened and while Ms Holotiks limitations of an actress may have diminished the effectiveness of her Big Revelation scene shes a great screamer when all Hell starts to break loose and Brownrigg indulged of some nice camera shots of her in various suggestive poses or stages of undress that show off what a pretty lady she is without exposing anything more than her contract stipulated Too bad!br br The real show stealer is Sam however and fans of what I have been taught to refer to as Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed by the rather shocking finale and there is something moving about how Sam runs to the protection of his friend and brutally kills everyone within arms reach in a matter of seconds that either suggests he was one mean motha before his lobotomy or the film is CUT In any event you wont be prepared for the ending the first time you see it even though you as the viewer know what the score is long before anyone else in the film has put it all togetherbr br Except for one person: Rhea MacAdams uproariously stereotyped old coot Mrs Callingham [who seems to be inspired by the Donald Sutherland Old Woman character from the Michael Reeves 1964 Christopher Lee film CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD in addition to a rather nasty death by round spike to the eye] who not only predicts the future but has the films most laugh out loud amusing bit of dialogue while on a walk in the garden with Ms Holotik that runs something like this --br br Its really beautiful out here Do you get out much Mrs Callingham? asks Holotik to which the old woman repliesbr br Its YOU who needs to get outbr br Hilarious and one of those things you gotta kind of see for yourself to get DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is available on at least a half dozen bargain bin codefree DVD releases by companies like Brentwood Home Video Diamond Entertainment VCI and Platinum Disc Corps HORROR CLASSICS series; I kind of like Alpha Videos sexily gorgeously decorated $6 release from 2003:br br Dig through those bargain bins!

Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there She is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor Is Dr Masters all she seems to be?br br DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me The acting is excellent my favorite performance being by Betty Chandler as Allyson the nymphomaniac The chills just jump right off the screen You probably wont have to say Its only a movie its only a movie it isnt that scary but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre which I do It is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed AXE is another cheap film that is looked down upon Maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesnt have excellent effects andor isnt considered a classic doesnt have a chance with an audience But I think that after people see this movie they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish
Youll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land Its not so much of a horror show but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients Scream is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive-in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors Notice the judge whos about to put on the ax from behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r!!! Not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness but when you get a chance remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady: Get out! Get out! And never ever come back! Dont you wish you havent looked in the basement?
If you love drive-in cheeze from the early 70s you will just love this oneHow could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum? You cant!

I was unsure what to expect from driving lessons- unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked All the way through the music acting and scenery were absolutely stunning Julie Walters as always gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie and Rupert Grint equally as goodgave a fantastic performance as the romantic Benbr br Right from the beginning I was forced into involuntary cringes bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend Evie A very controversial story probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long timebr br Highly recommend to anyone seeking a good British film and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself
I had to get this movie since it didnt come to where I live I waited patiently and it was worth the wait I totally fell in love with this movie The chemistry between Walters and Grint you could see since they also worked together on the Harry Potter moviesThe woman who plays his overbearing righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is I think she did a great job playing the role I only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it LOL but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down (snickers) I totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch Rent this movie I do have to say that Rupert really did a great job and its nice to see that hes doing movies outside of Harry Pottereven though I totally love him as Ron Weasley The whole cast did a great job and I hope Rupert continues to act outside of Harry Potter to broaden his skill!
I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a local rental store Having just watched the latest Harry Potter installment I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work Reading the description on back about an overzealous evangelical Christian do-gooder and identifying as an evangelical Christian myself I thought Ooohthis should be interesting And so it was I found Mr Brocks story beautiful in both words and images; and sadly enough all too familiar The contrast he drew between Bens parents interpretations of what it means to be a Christian was a poignant commentary on how Christians view themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them On the one hand we have Bens mom stating Whatever happens behind these walls Ben were Gods ambassadors We show the world a smiling face On the other hand is Bens dad discussing truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film At the end of his monologue he states The more a person parades their Christianity for the benefit of others the less I am inclined to trust the Christianity they claim God tells us true faith is the freedom to choose truth Now how you express that the way the manner the means at your disposal these things are of no consequence be you Christian or atheist unless in your heart you are true If only our churches were full of Christians who ascribed to this latter definition of what it means to be a follower of Jesus rather than the former What a difference that would make! As a Christian and a psychologist I would want an imperfect yet authentic faith over a perfectly polished image any day What a tragedy  to feel like I always need to play a role when really I just need to rest in the freedom of being completely who God made me to be I think Mr Brock provides a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom in Christ looks like I recommend this film for anyone who desires a fresh look at faith
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoymentRupert Grint played the part marvelously and has a general knack for the acting business The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot and was a character one could almost instantly loathe This reminded me in a way of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood Not by means of actual content of the film but the premises and overall tone to the film itself Driving Lessons is a coming of age story which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother the lack of freedom and the discovery of oneself
I thought it was going to be a lousy movie honestly I mean Rupert Grint RON acting in a movie different from Harry Potter was actually really difficult to picture it But as the movie started it showed that this guy does have talent I mean is the best actor of the HP trio for reference have you seen Emma Watson trying to act? Or what about Daniels acting? Both lack experience even though they have acted in a million Harry Potter movies Ben his character is a very shy boy incapable of showing his true feelings about everything his despise about his over ruling mom and the resentful anger towards his father who is unable to step up and confront his unfaithful wife Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! Her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past while she tries to remember Shakespearian sonnets is absolutely wonderful! Also it appears that many youth is wasted in religious nonsense acts
This movie is a great film The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age The movie goes on about how Ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself Ben then meets Evie who he makes a very special bond with The two take a journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and Evie share This is the movie that you watch by yourself or with someone else No matter what you will all feel what Ben goes through in the movie It is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as Bens Lessons
I being a fan of Rupert Grint rented this film a few months ago I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors It was entertaining and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most well known character of Ron Weasley His subtle portrayal of Ben and everyone elses great acting made this film very likablebr br Ben a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother is looking for a job He finds one and becomes the I guess you could call assistant to Evie a retired actress At first it is just a way for him to earn some money But after a while he and Evie seem to develop a friendship Evie helps Ben break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself and in the end they both seem to need each otherbr br Whether you are a fan of Rupert Grint or not this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors
Id heard about this movie but didnt see it until my daughter who saw it on a flight to Australia told me it was a great movie I was interested in seeing whether Rupert Grint away from Harry Potter was showing the promise you see in the Potter movies I wasnt disappointed Hes become a fine actor showing a range in Driving Lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own and others esteem Going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging-actress employer its obvious that hes ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage But the jewel of this movie was Julie Walters Id seen her previously in the Potter movies Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls and loved her In Driving Lessons as she does lines from poetry and Shakespeare I was awed by her timing command of the language and body language Im hoping it was make-upcostuming as she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis though no mention of it is made in the movie-- as a nurse I can say that she did this perfectly portraying a woman on the brink of old-age but clinging to the sparkling past that she reveled in This is one of the best movies Ive seen in a long time and I wish Id seen it in a theatre first-- but I doubt it ever played anywhere here in Albuquerque We miss out on so many of these types of movies here
I really only watched this movie because it had Rupert Grint in it (who I knew as Ron from the Harry Potter movies) I had never really appreciated Rupert as an actor until this movie I loved the entire film Rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious quirky movie I think the movie could have been fine without the sex but it worked somehow I cant wait to see more of Ruperts films in the future Julie Walters also did an amazing job In the Harry Potter movies she has a very small role so I didnt quite know what to expect from her either But she was wonderful as Dame Evie The part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious Overall an amazing movie
Ben Marshall a teen ager from a religious background is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother Laura She suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household In fact the family has taken a widower to board with them Robert Marshall the father is a pastor at the local church; hed much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his churchbr br The job Ben applies is with an older actress Evie Walton who wants him to do things for her around the house Dame Evie as she calls herself is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not that great In fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but shed rather forget about it Evie who is a compulsive liar tells Ben shes dying only to forget it conveniently later on when she comes clean to the boy br br Ben is obviously in awe of the larger than life personality of his employer He has been taking driving lessons Evie asks him to take a camping trip which he does against his better judgment He knows that it will provoke his mothers fury Not content with that Evie decides to go on to Edinburgh where she has been invited to read at an arts festival It is this trip that solidifies their bond Ben gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic Bryonybr br When Ben gets back everything crumbles at home His mother who has been having an affair with a parishioner decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has been having an affair with Ben and Evies relationship survives the test of time He also begins to see his own father in a different light br br Jeremy Brock the writer of Driving Lessons and other memorable English films takes his first directorial job with this engaging comedy The mixture of show business and religion loyalty and friendship are explored in his screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies We have seen the similar situation before as in Billy Elliott where Julie Walters plays a nurturing role with a younger man We had read the film was based on Mr Brocks own experience while working Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young br br Julie Walters who plays Evie Walton is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie She always delivers Ms Walters is a welcome presence in any film she appears and she does wonders with her fake dame Laura Linney a luminous player herself doesnt quite get our sympathy with her icy mother Rupert Grint famous for his Harry Potters movies plays Ben the young man who sees in Evie a kind soul Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines
lovely i just love the movie i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor his expressions are great spectacular the movie was excellent Julie Walters it was perfect too I think that Rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love Rupert have a beautiful smile a beautiful voice and a wonderful accent i think that the movie was great and was great see Rupert in another thing but harry potter and its a very good actor so it deserves that and more he just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an Oscar academy award there are some actors that do not act very well but have a Oscar anyway it does not matter but he is perfect brilliant and beautiful
DRIVING LESSONS is a little film that sneaks up on you What at first seems to be a bit of fluffy nonsense comedy British style is at its base a very fine story about coming of age and the needs for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly Writer Jeremy Brock (Mrs Brown Charlotte Gray The Last King of Scotland) here directs his own screenplay and the result is a cohesive progressively involving tale filled with fascinating and diverse characters each performed by sterling actorsbr br Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint standing firmly on his own as a developing actor post Harry Potter series) is a quiet plain little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching Vicar father (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive rigid evangelical do-gooder mother (Laura Linney) in a home where needy people such as the murderous cross-dressing Mr Fincham (Jim Norton) take precedence over family matters: the mother is by the way having an affair with priest Peter (Oliver Milburn) using Ben as her cover! Sad Ben is among other things attempting to learn to drive a car His mother is a poor teacher and decides he needs professional lessons AND needs to get a job to help pay for poor Mr Finchams needs Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters) an elderly has-been actress who is as zany as any character ever created She hires Ben and the fireworks begin Through a series of incidents including a camping trip Evie demands they take the two learn lifes lessons missing from each others natures: Ben learns self respect and self confidence and Evie finds a true friend who will allow her to drop her stagy facade and be the dear human being she has been hidingbr br Julie Walters always offering the finest skills of acting in every character she creates finds a role like no other here: she is outlandishly wild and lovable Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age Ben The chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film Harold and Maude Laura Linney is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire And the supporting cast is a panorama of fine characterizations This film is a delightful surprise and one sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and acting - and message!

After seeing the Harry Potter movies Ive been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; yet weve been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the JK Rowling series Mainly instead of a trio the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on Daniel and Emma being that theyre the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving Rupert dead-end No matter every actor has a time to shine and Ruperts light hits him for once in this moviebr br Driving Lessons is called the Harold and Maude of this generation with Rupert Grint playing the role of Ben Marshall a young British lad who lives with his domineering mother (Laura Linney) and a wimp of a vicar (priest) father for which he wants a job in the summer but cant find work while at the same time taking his driving tests (and failing) and writing poetry for a young girl who doesnt have any interest in himbr br Ben seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady He takes the job and realizes that hes in for a fun of surprises as Evie (Julie Walters Ruperts mother in the Harry Potter series) an out-of-work actress who is also a poet giving Ben the run for his money They bond where and tell each other secrets along with Evie acting like a child and getting into mischief where she drags Ben along for a country road trip From their not only does Ben drive all the way from Britain to Scotland since Evie needs to recite at a local library but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man in which Ben starts becoming a manbr br There is mishap and at the same time rejoice with Ben and Evie along with saying that I was very pleased about the film when it came out in theaters and I was impressed with Rupert Grints acting especially if he showed the rest of the world that even though he brings a bit of Ron Weasley within Ben Marshall theres no stopping the actor on his brilliant performance
Ive felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him So even though I had never heard of this film before when it appeared in my cable TV listings I immediately switched to that channel I am so happy that I did! br br Ive read from other reviewers that they dont generally like coming of age stories; I on the other hand quite do I am one of those who is always coming of age; I have been since I was 12 Im 52 now and I will probably continue until Im 92 Coming of age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day brings The suddenness of the realization the magnitude of it sometimes throws us into disarray If we try to shelter our delicate selves from that then yes I can see how the coming of age can end But if we simply dust ourselves off and settle into the new direction weve discovered then were all of a sudden on a new path and were just as alive as we were yesterday only stronger brighter and I daresay more interesting br br So thats what this movie was about This was a coming of age story all the way round; young Ben his father Father Robert and certainly Dame Evie all went through a marvelous transformation In fact so too did Mr Fincham didnt he?! All did I suspect except in fact the mother in spite of her enormous opportunity so to do provided by the events of the end of the film One is left with the feeling that she will continue on exactly the same path shes been on only with perhaps a different supporting castbr br So an excellent film that could not possibly have been made in America which is utterly depressing to think about but thank God we have a steady supply of films made elsewhere that we occasionally get to see I really heartily recommend this film so long as you dont mind cringing through those parts of it that are all too familiar to us all and grinning through all the rest of it
A beautiful film One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed Made me think about death but not fear it think about life but not hide from it A movie that gave both love for all I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell A movie that made me think of love and all that I have lost but no sadness graced my eyes for some strange reason relief A child of two worlds god and theater And a good bit of wine and irony! I most highly recommend br br When The S Hits The Fan Get A Tent Oh and we should all go camping Every day
Sweet entertaining tale of a young 17 12 year old boy controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and withdrawn father and how he finds himself through his work with a retired eccentric and tragic actress Very well acted especially by Julie Walters Rupert Grint plays the role of the teenage boy well showing his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter series of films Laura Linney plays his ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption so theres no room to like her at all But the film is a very entertaining film made well by the British in the style of the likes of Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls
Loved this movie what a hoot Rupert and Julie are great together with Rupert being almost poker faced against Julies animation which worked well Laura did a good job as the overbearing motherJulie of course is marvellous as usual While this movie will keep you laughing most of the time it also has a poignant side to it as it unravels the secrets in the lives of the main characters Interesting that it was entitled Driving Lessons as this might lead you to believe this is the main feature of the movie which directly it is not though it certainly could be seen as Ben finally being in the driving seat in his own life Like most things that are funny in life there is always the sad side and there are some moving moments in this movie Very enjoyable movie and well worth watching
I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot It was very watchable and very funny Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch Bens character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potterbr br Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Bens over protective mother the only thing they went wrong with is by making her tooVillain-y Bens father was also an interesting contrast to his mother and in the end he is quite honourable too The only character i wasnt keen on was Bryony she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thoughtbr br Overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch one of my favourite films of the year easily
Driving Lessons sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on when Grints character comes into contact with Evee (Walters) a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego Grint betrays his overpowering and over-Christian mother (Linney) and goes off travelling with Evee to Scotland to accompany her on a trip to participate in a Poetry reading something she claims could be her last due to an illnessbr br Grints portrayal of a caged youngster brainwashed by an overbearing and even hypocritical mother is the masterpiece of this film His portrayal of a downtrodden teen in search of his true morals and happiness is captivating to watch unfold throughout The film is sharply shot and well paced with very few moments leaving you tired an achievement particularly considering the nature of the plot Walters really grabs hold of her character with both hands and successfully brings the audience to her side of things emphasising Linneys ironic immorality throughout Her role in Driving Lessons is enjoyable and memorable in every sensebr br The plot develops nicely leaving the audience cheering on Grint as he chases back to Evees place during his lunch break during his stint at a local bookshop to apologise for his wrongdoings The values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag in a very consistent way The overbearing (and relieving) main idea being that religion doesnt lead to happiness and certainly doesnt lead to moralitybr br The audience are left sympathising with the radical but lovable Evee with her and Grint making an irresistible partnership on the big screen transferred directly from their debut in the Harry Potter series Charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must-see this Christmas
I wasnt expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face Julie Walters Rupert Grint and Laura Linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas with words He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward Each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter 75% of the time The film satisfies all and I hope that soon it might be released in all US theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities It is a MUST see!
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival Rupert Grint shows he can act past Harry Potter Laura Linney is amazing as the overbearing mother Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton with a mouth worse than a sailor I hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it This film is not only about Driving Lessons but life lessons Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life Its an amazing film from an amazing director whose taken his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see and everyone who can should
Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films Mrs Brown and Charlotte Gray Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring Academy Award Nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and from the Harry Potter series Rupert Grint The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint) a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney) After his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever free-spirited and heavy on the bottle retired actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters) The pair embarks upon wonderful adventures from camping to walks around the block to the simple conversations about life Challenging the domineering mother as well as each other along the way the two develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes both their livesbr br The comedic elements are flawless and precise especially coming from the British veteran Julie Walters Brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first time directors could only dream Directing comes naturally to Brock as he builds up stunning imagery that breaks the surfaces and plunges the viewer down into an overabundance of adoration and creation Even the subtle score by unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn accentuate the tone and manner Brock had no trouble in generatingbr br Laura Linney is always making her mark in films as she does as Laura The bossy and overbearing mother is at times unbearable and with Linney at the helm of it we are engulfed into that persona The complexity of her character couldnt have been more flawlessly portrayed by anyone else Rupert Grint breaks away from Ron Weasley and tries on someone new His performance is more responsive than loquacious but Grint gives us someone brand new to a child performance and the viewer gets to enjoy it But the standout is coming from Oscar nominated actress Julie Walters who gives Evie a life of her own Despite the role being clearly a leading one Walters fairs better in the supporting category where I believe she can simply take home the prize Evie is a mix of Clementine Kruczynski and Mrs Laura Henderson with her free spirit and lovable persona Hopefully her role will not go unnoticed this awards seasonbr br Driving Lessons isnt an out of this world experience but a fine enjoyable one that any viewer could just kick back and learn a little something about life love and friendship coming in the forms of the most beautiful colors and sizesbr br Grade: 
I cant disagree with a previous comment that Driving Lessons is more than a little twee but one mans indictment is anothers endorsement I suppose In my book this film succeeds on pure charm no small feat in itselfbr br I cant help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway Julie Walters Dame Evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress Though Evie hasnt had steady work in years its unclear the last time she visited reality if ever (think Edina from AbFab at 65 at one point she is even forced to come to grips with her kitsch-factor) Some may find her annoying but I think thats the point to emphasize just how much she pushes the reserved Bens (Rupert Grint) buttons to force him out of his shell Ben is equally isolated from reality living his whole life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother who Laura Linney manages to breath some life into despite being a fairly one-dimensional character (ye olde overbearing religious mom) I was rather impressed with Rupert Grint who I found to give a very honest and believable performance (not to mention sweet as all get-out) I cant think of many teen actors today for whom I can say thatbr br The heart of the movie is what happens when Ben and Evies worlds collide At first Ben is understandably tentative but also intrigued as Evie is essentially the exact opposite of everything hes ever known With the combination of Evies persistence and Bens helpful nature a genuine sweetness develops between them culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives Ben his first real taste of independencebr br The tone is consistently light even through a few brief melodramatic bits but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance a credit to the main actors All in all Id say that if youre willing to sit back and let yourself be charmed by some lovely performances Driving Lessons shouldnt disappoint However if cute is not in your movie vocabulary best to stay awaybr br One other minor note the soundtrack features the music of Sufjan Stevens prominently a nice touch
I saw this tonight with moderate expectations - if Tartan Films have picked up on something and are releasing it the thats generally a good sign however Im not normally a fan of Julie Walters generally disliking her comedy roles (sorry to any fans but its a personal thing - I just dont find her funny in comedy)br br This was magnificent though - a great performance by all but Grint and Walters are exceptional! Plenty of laughs plenty of pathos great timing and a wonderfully paced film - such a coming of age film wouldnt normally be something Id expect to like so much but I cant recommend this highly enough - and watch Rupert Grint as he matures into a fine fine actor
I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts and to be honest I didnt know how much I would like it I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised Driving Lessons is a modest simple film which draws you in right from the start Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly Hes definitely one to look out for in the future Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity The highlight of the film for me was Evies rather colourful poem It shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs In my opinion watching Driving Lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours The scenery was also striking especially the countryside Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable I strongly disagree with
A British twist on Harold and Maude Driving Lessons features a reined-in Rupert Grint and an over-the-top Julie Walters While it is true that Grint is stone-faced like a redheaded Benjamin Braddock for the first half of the movie it does not deter from the quirky family film--there are things going on that are out of his characters experience that would create a shell-shocked reaction The chemistry between Walters and Grint carries the film though Laura Linneys hard work to make her written stereotype human is also notable These performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists like Sufjan Stevens John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica make this kids popcorn flick worth a Saturday afternoon
I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing The combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile The movie was about a seventeen year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious The seventeen year old Ben decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life It is very comical and touching I honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone If you didnt catch one of the showings at the film festival its supposed to come out in theaters later in the year Please go see it! It is a great film
Well Im an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento Fulci Bava Sr and Bava Jr only to quote the most famous La villa delle anime maledette is one of the most unknown movie of this genre shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my ears (althoug he directed six movies this is the price Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome)  But the film is not so bad And its absolutely not correct to talk about trash OK the plot is not so original; it reminds me stuff like the Amytville series (the year is the same of Amityville Possession by Damiano Damiani) or Shock the last work of Mario Bava But you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer (like Mario Bava movies); so the most important thing is the atmosphere not the story or the characters; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement The rest remain in the background I think the movie works; not so good but works; its surely better than a lot of Hollywoodian production like the Haunting which have a bigger budget but not bigger ideas
A BUSTER KEATON Silent Shortbr br Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT (scapegoat) for a dangerous escaped murdererbr br This is a wonderful hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best In what is essentially a series of chases Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chiefbr br Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats Buster Keaton (1895-1966) mastered physical comedy at a very early age An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928 Writer director star & stuntman - Buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience More akin to Fairbanks than Chaplin Busters films were full of splendid adventure exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable His theme of a little man against the world who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity dominates his films Through every calamity & disaster Buster remained the Great Stone Face a stoic survivor in a universe gone madbr br In the late 1920s Buster was betrayed by his managerbrother-in-law and his contract was sold to MGM which proceeded to nearly destroy his career Teamed initially with Jimmy Durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies Buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent Finally before lung cancer took him at age 70 he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered Now well past his centenary Buster Keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinemas true authentic geniuses And he knew how to make people laugh
Buster Keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films and they dont come more rib-ticklingly funny than this gem The dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix-up with a wanted felon This leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the Wanted signs The Goat is choc-a-bloc with brilliant site gags from the opening scene at the bread queue right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end A Keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking as sound is never something you needed with him His movies explain themselves through the wonderful (yet incredibly dangerous) things he did to himself It isnt hard to see just how influential he really was - the man is every bit as thoroughly amazing today as he was in 1921
This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keatons absolute best Through a long series of silly mistakes Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer And as a result most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability I have seen some that have had wilder stunts but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace In particular there is a scene where he runs across a table jumps on a mans shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed such as how he really comes to believe that hes actually killed someone By the way this film is VERY similar to COPS also by Keaton but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeingbr br This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater
Saw this for the first time on UK TV with good musical accompaniment The elevator scene is class especially when he does the going-down thing in the phone booth and then fiddles with the floor-indicator The jump through the transom is really impressive and theres so much more Apart from all the stuff thats been mentioned before theres the fight with the man whos been bullying the woman with the dog - it just looks so simple The only drawback is the plot - he gets mixed up with Dead Eye Dan who then escapes but doesnt reappear even when some more gangsters get involved later on The scene where it looks like hes shooting at the fat inspector is funny but would have been better if Dead Eye was the one pulling the trigger
There is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail Think of that conmans conman WCFields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY or the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER of Mae West in SHE DONE HIM WRONG The skirting of the law is inevitable and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic Think of Lloyd in his first talkie WELCOME DANGER trying to assist the San Francisco Police Department in the midst of a crime wave and making police sergeant Edgar Kennedy want to kill him Think of Laurel and Hardy as ill-fated cops in MIDNIGHT PATROL I find this type of hostility is so patent in all these giants (and their peers) comedy that even a fake title for a film deals with it Think of Jerry Seinfeld in one episode of his series creating a Three Stooges short SAPPY PAPPIES where the boys end up being electrocuted for murderbr br Buster Keaton frequently pulls in the forces of law and order to be his opponents in his comedies Look at STEAMBOAT BILL JR where he tries to spring his dad from a calaboose But he actually had more conflict from police forces in his shorts In CONVICT 13 he is dragged back to prison when mistaken for an escaped convict In COPS (perfect title - if you see it youd understand) the police force of a large city is repeatedly looking for Keaton mistaken for a terrorist) And in THE GOAT he is unable to avoid the police for most of the filmbr br Keaton is a tramp just looking for food But he is totally unlucky When he sees a stranger throw a lucky horseshoe (which Keaton earlier ignored) over his shoulder and then find a wallet full of money Keaton tries the same thing and hits a cop in the head The cop gives chase and Keaton (as luck would have it) runs into another cop tries to act normal but ends by throwing the other cop into the path of the first Soon he has three cops chasing him Briefly shaking them he walks by a window at the local jail where local murderer Dead Shot Dan (Malcolm St Clair) is being photographed Passing in back of the barred windows Keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight in The desperado notes this and ducks as the picture is taken When Dead Shot flees the police it is Keatons face on all the wanted postersbr br (St Clair would eventually be a successful director of silent and early sound comedies although in his later biography would be a stint at 20th Century Fox where his work with Laurel & Hardy was below par)br br Keaton flees to another town by train (disconnecting the passenger cars containing his pursuers from the locomotive and tender) This is the film (by the way) that has two famous Keaton jokes His arrival on the locomotive is done in a distant shot with it coming closer and closer and suddenly the audience sees Keaton sitting on the cowcatcher br br The second famous sequence goes later (and may have influenced Chaplin somewhat in the beginning of CITY LIGHTS) Keaton had accidentally knocked out a man who was arguing too violently with a pretty woman with a dog (Virginia Fox) When he sees the posters calling him a murderer he thinks he killed the man He is being chased in this town by a suspicious chief of police (Joe Roberts) and momentarily loses Roberts in the park A statue of Man-of-War is being constructed and the sculptor is unveiling a clay model of the horse) Keaton is seen seated on the clay model trying to maintain his dignity as the clay legs of the horse start collapsing under his weight br br Keaton manages to meet the pretty Ms Fox who invites him home for dinner Only he doesnt realize her father is Roberts The last five minutes of the film deal Keaton fleeing and avoiding Roberts while he and Fox get away togetherbr br Its a funny comedy and a wonderful example of Keatons work at his best
This is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time We have been on a Keaton fest around here after purchasing some of his films In this one Buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about Buster - his creativity The opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there
To my eternal shame Ive never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies Nosferatu However if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from Buster Keaton then Ill probably try to watch a few more This is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies The premise such as it is focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as Keaton is mistaken for renowned bad-guy Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair) This leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate Keatonbr br Youre left amazed and entertained in equal measures Keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stunt-man judging by the way he leaps and jumps around like Jackie Chan on speed And the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard - my Better Half had to cut short a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much! If youve never experienced a silent movie like this then it is nothing short of a revelation to watch - it certainly blew away any ideas I may have had about silent films Naturally it isnt as polished as todays movies - the acting is pretty awful truth be told but that doesnt matter because youre enjoying the movie regardless Anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed Brilliant!
Not all but most of this story is Buster being mistaken for Dead Shot Dan a notorious criminal br br There really is no story just a series of adventures to show off Busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing The 27-minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our herobr br Earlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after Keaton and later its Big Joe Roberts a rotund cop - and father a girl Buster is interested in - who chases him Those latter scenes were the best I thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live That was Keaton at his bestbr br Its just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares? Its Buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose: to entertain us Just think: 85 years after this film was made there are people (like me) still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics! Cool!
This Metro film is episodic but nearly a constant series of chases mainly trying to escape police whether real or imagined as Buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal It is consistently inventive and entertaining Its greatest value is in its documenting what Hollywood looked like in the early twenties since 95% of it is shot outside among the streets and building exteriors of the time One gem moment and one gem sequence are present herebr br The great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it - with Buster glumly sitting on the cowcatcher and thus moving from a long shot to a close-up within secondsbr br The great sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator - one constantly being mistaken for the other with races from floor to floor - one of the great Keaton gagsbr br Kinos print is sharp and clear - almost pristine There is a violinpiano score accompaniment This is one to seek out and enjoy
Along with Cops The Goat is one of Keatons two funniest shorts Which makes it one of the best shorts ever made This has an decent plot for a short and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags Keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict (how the mistake happens is a classic) and then must elude the authorities Best gags - the bread line and t he elevator
I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced expertly photographed beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasnt always the way with Busters comedies (See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism) If I had to describe this film in one word Id call it effortless but if I were permitted two Id call it seemingly effortless for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease Still they didnt call him the Great Stone Face for nothing: Buster never let the public see him sweatbr br A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set along Millionaires Row ie on a bread line in a grim urban setting where Buster waits patiently at the back of the line and as a result doesnt get fed But it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos; Buster has our sympathy but he never asks for it Before long through a series of accidents coincidences and absurd misunderstandings Buster is believed to be an escaped killer named Dead Shot Dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around and yet while hes clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him and that he hasnt time to feel sorry for himself anyway he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trapbr br Just as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either which is especially impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the most laugh-packed short comedies in existence This is the film that features that iconic shot of Buster riding a trains cow-catcher right up to the very lens of the camera which isnt a gag exactly but sure is laugh-provoking in its own strange way Meanwhile there are gags involving guns dogs cops an incredibly furry mustache and a clay statue of a horse that melts under Busters weight (a surreal sight indeed) but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when Buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis Big Joe Roberts a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady Virginia Fox Trapped in Big Joes dining room Buster leap-frogs over him and sails through a transom turns a phone-booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fade-out gagbr br To say more would be a disservice to first-time viewers I only wish I could see this film in a theater full of people whod never seen it before and float on the laughter Live musical accompaniment would be nice too; and incidentally the musical score supplied by Kino for their home videoDVD version of THE GOAT is first-rate serving as icing on an already tasty cake
Ok i am a huge Traci fan so her just being in the movie automatically makes it rank at the 85+ rating But even besides her being in it i thought it was a good movie especially for it being an HBO movie But i am afraid if you take Traci out of the movie it would just be ok But a person cant do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress She just keeps getting better and better
I really like Traci Lords She may not be the greatest actress in the world but shes rather good in this She play the dowdy conservative reporter to a T Its a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while Jeff Fahey is also good as Tracis boss I think given a decent break Traci could be a top actress Shes certainly no worse than some of todays leading ladies
A very good offering from HBO Traci Lords is becoming a much-better dramatic actress with each effort I hope to see this attractive lady in more challenging roles in the future instead of the flighty roles she has been stuck with in the past
Good Filmbr br I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale £299 seems like a good deal and it is Thing is the film is named To Kill For It took a little detective work to find out its original namebr br In the UK it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ability to sell Having seen Final Destination 3 last night it in my view should have been a 18br br Maybe the fact the delightful Traci Lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18 Such a shamebr br Traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions She ability to turn what is branded a B-Movies into a Fine performance is nothing short of amazingbr br Long Live Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress
In Extramarital we see B-actress Traci Lords at her very best Shes all wrapped in horror & suspense here a type of role that suits her very wellbr br This mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from Paul Verhoevens Basic Instinct (1992) by the way However there are differences between the main female characters of Traci Lords (99) and that of Sharon Stone (92) For instance in Extramarital Traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past We also shouldnt forget mentioning Extramaritals three main actors By putting down a convincing performance each of them greatly contributes to the overall quality of this movie br br All this makes Extramarital into a very enjoyable B-movie Its storyline shows a good build-up its tense being well-spread from start to finish This movie keeps you at the edge of your seat until its unexpected end
The movie was very good Im an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didnt figure out who did it I wasnt happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that cloying Please know that while these Poirot movies are good they just dont have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they dont have Japp Ms Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot I have seen every actor whos played him The worst was Peter Ustinov!

Just after having moved into his new cottage in the English country Hercule Poirot gets an invitation to dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell the owners of a large mansion nearby But the next day one of the guests is found shot near the pool and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps awaybr br This Agatha Christie mystery is somewhat thin though the killers plan is still very clever Its the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level This episode mostly keeps the serious tone of Five Little Pigs and Sad Cypress but contains more dark humor than them The cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point Edward Fox (as the butler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatell) though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful Megan Dodds as the ahead-of-her-time Henrietta: her one-on-one confrontations with Suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film Oh and since an English police inspector does get involved in the case I think they could have brought Philip Jackson back for this one ()
This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of The Hollow It could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one Christies best but what makes The Hollow special is the characterisation and I found the actors here more or less without exception were perfect in their parts In such a uniformly good cast its difficult to select stand out performances but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just perfect as Lucy Angkatell What is extraordinary is that she not only conveys Lucys dottiness tactlessness and her more lovable qualities BUT she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact Lucy is not really all that nice! Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price very affecting as Gerda John Christow is really quite an unlikeable character but Jonathan Cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in himbr br As I said the script follows the story quite faithfully The only disconcerting thing I found was that Midge and Edwards relationship really comes out of nowhere and I do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor! Theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done The whole thing looks beautiful as well really capturing a perfect English autumnbr br Its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing
This movie deserves a 2010 if I could give one THE HOLLOW is a great Hercule Poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people I am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel There was no major difference that I could spot The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel The acting was superb and the music as usual was amazing quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either In no other movie that Ive seen so far has Poirot been portrayed so brilliantly! Hats off to the producers-- they have made a movie that I along with many others will cherish for a long time to come!
Excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife Gerda (Claire Price) as well of course as David Suchet I did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point The ending which I wont divulge (someone describes it on the Board in answer to someone elses question if you are interested) I found really sad Despite Agatha Christies reputation for writing cardboard characters I thought these really well-rounded by and largebr br The pacing of the story was good and I enjoyed seeing Sarah Miles as Lucy and Edward Hardwicke (Cedrics son I believe in addition to being a well-known Dr Watson)) as her husband
David Suchet(Poirot)FoolProof03 gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said If he had a cocktail he always had a napkin to blot the excess on his mouth with unbelievable perfection! You could just view the expressions on the detectives face and see that he never missed an item of importance in the suspects behavior The beautiful Falls Colors through out the English countryside was simply breath taking Megan Dodds Bait2000 gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from Mr Poirot A very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of David Suchet as Mr Poirot!
In a better civilization this and many other of the David Suchet movies would be released in theaters The plots are fabulous (no Id no clue who had done it but the clues were all there if Id been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery) the production values astounding the acting (from Edward Fox Sarah Miles Lysette Anthony Megan Dodds and of course David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) simply perfect the dialogue wonderful the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuffbr br One of the pleasures of these Hercule Poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them! Here were have two - the sexy sinuous Megan Doods and the stunning Lysette Anthonybr br You really cant go wrong renting these - theyre just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind constantly working because its all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything - and the settings gorgeousbr br I cant think of movies that stimulate thought more than these Hercule PoirotDavid Suchet movies Its impossible to over-praise them - and I had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an Agatha Christie
The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot It s set on a country house on a weekend As always all the guests are suspects and its up to Poirot to figure out the truth With movies like this its always best not to give too much away so Ill stop here What I loved in the Hollow was that its a mystery the old fashioned way When Poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example Everybody seems to be the culprit Theres that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the storybr br You can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experiencebr br The actors are all very good As a curiosity notice Edward Hardwicke who played Dr Watson in Sherlock Holmes Nice to see him after a few years Suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the timebr br I did find out who the murderer was but still its not predictable and Its also very believablebr br So in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasurebr br 
i first saw this movie back in the early 90sand instantly fell in love with itrichard benjamin and his wife paula made the 1981 movie saturday the 14thin 1981 prior to making this movie in 1983i think they work quite well togetherthis movie made me laugh on several occasionsit also has a young molly ringwaldwho would later go on in the late 1980s to do movies such as pretty in pink and sixteen candlesit is fun watching her a little youngeralthough not seen by many peoplei dont even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this moviebut when i first came acrossed it i was glad i didi gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as i think it is a fun movie the whole family can enjoylastly i would like to say its not available on DVDso i picked up a VHS copy on ebayso if your interestedyou probably can find one on thereit might be in the $20-$30 dollar range but i got mind for $12 bucksi wish they would eventually release this on DVD
and Im so disappointed because I cant seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywherebr br Its a kind of mix of Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager This was made when Molly was still a brunette just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pinkbr br Id definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy with an edge! br br If anyone has a copy of this or knows where I can get oneplease leave a message for me - itll be much appreciated
This has to be one of the funniest movies Ive ever seen The idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness When mom and dad both lose there jobs not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub They decide its in their families best interest to move to Oregon Once there everything goes wrong An interesting cast of characters compliment this movie Including a young Molly Ringwaldthis a movie I would definetly recommend
The story is about a working girl (Ann Sothern) who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend (Paul Kelly) This boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late The final straw is when Sothern has a birthday and Kelly says hes too busy to take her out to celebrate So not wanting to just stay home she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton) Sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after Sothern breaks off her relationship with Kelly that new boyfriend Hamilton is a love em and leave em sort of guy How all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict--just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectlybr br This is a very modest little film from Columbia Pictures--with a relatively small budget as well as second-tier stars Its clearly a B-movie despite there being small roles played by a Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell--as both had yet to become famous Now this is NOT to say that these are bad actors or the production isnt any good In fact given the production values this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline Thats because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across Plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them The ending in particular is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing! Because of these factors the film earns a 7 of 10
Blind Date is one of three stories-made-into-movie by author Vida Hurst Lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934 Mickey Rooney as a mouthy little punk He seems to be in the film for comedic and homey family values Jane Darwell again plays the strong-willed mother just as she had in Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow Incident Ann Sothern is Kitty who has been dating Bill (Paul Kelly) but meets up with rich Bob Hartwell played by Neil Hamilton who may or may not be better for her You can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the Hays production code -- at one point Kitty says she cant be up there alone with him if there isnt anyone else in the housewhat a change from just a year or two prior when anything and everything was OK Good solid plot but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk It raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man; should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice or just find a man with big bucks as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated? and how do men change when their situation changes ? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene TV viewers from the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon from Batman Also some weird drama in the off-screen lives for some of the cast in this one --Paul Kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer who was 20 years older; Rooney ended up being married eight times Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) both knocked themselves off in real life The title Blind Date has been reused many times for films TV series and even cartoons but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one
Working girl Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly) who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage After being stood up on her birthday Kitty goes on a double-dateblind date where she meets department store heir Bob Hartwell (Hamilton) She falls in love but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress rather than his wife Faithful Bill rallies round to comfort her and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement pressured in part by Bills support of her family after she loses her job When Bob returns however convinced that he wants marriage after all will Kitty follow her heart or her conscience? br br This film was a lot better than Id expected it to be The character of Bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic Irishman type that Jack Carson played so often But Kelly (and the script) infuse the character with real compassion and love and Bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group Viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless Hartwell! The tone of the film wavers however between light-hearted romance and a much darker side especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at Bills garagebr br The cast is rounded out by the dependable Jane Darwell as Kittys mother an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious Mickey Rooney as Kittys younger brother and Spencer Charters as Kittys neer-do-well father
I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin He prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation it was HILARIOUS I can see how it would be damaging to some audiences and the subject is not funny at all but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard I thought Id pee They dont come until after the halfway point but when they do oh Godyou will die Oh and Jim Brown is brilliant Hes not in a lot of the movie but when hes there you know whose movie it is Naturally the best line in the movie (and the funniest) is his; youll know it when you hear it
This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70s exploitation film except it was done in the late 80s for the direct to video marketbr br You have a young couple in love but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence When the boyfriend goes to jail the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals who are everyone in this movie except for the cops First she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord Jim Brown money she becomes Browns property Then shes basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named forbr br As if this isnt enough reason to see this movie you also have Anthony Geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor but hes really a major crack dealer In a sleazy yet hilarious scene he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix In an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor That scene and another where Jim Brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical Lead actress Cheryl Kay was really good in this film Tarantino bring her backbr br Its not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that Tarantino is a major fan of this It has just the right blend of comedy action sex romance and yes a central message to stay away from drugs Jim Browns villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80s B villain Wings Hauser in Vice Squad Sometimes I think there should be a b movie Oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged In the meantime lets hope that the modern straight to DVD filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor
Crack House (1989) was one of the few film during the 80s that falls into this genre Whats supposed to be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white-exploitation exercise in depravity Theres nothing wrong with that however The video presentation even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show Richard turncoat Roundtreebr br The movie follows two young lovers in high school One of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl One of them gets turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex-friends Jim Brown appears as the movies Mister Big hes one bad dude who still can punk-out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word Luke from General Hospital makes a guest star spot as wellbr br If you like hard edge sleaze then this movies for you Sadly Hollywood doesnt make these any more and when they do its neither exploitative nor entertainingbr br Recommended for sleaze fans
When I first got wind of this picture it was just called Shepherd and was supposed to be the film that would put JCVD back into chances of doing theatrical shtuff I was very well excited about the whole piecebr br By the time it was titled The Shepherd: Border Patrol I was tap-dancing in excitement for this flick With Isaac Fluorentine at the helm of directing and JJ Perry pulling stunt coordination I almost peed me pants in anticipation Pics were released of JCVD kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as Scott Adkins playing what I thought was the villain and I was mind-blown in excitement I thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuadebr br Then it came out I ordered it off Blockbuster online for $20 and was ready for anything The reviews from vandammefannet kinda had my ideas alittle altered but I braced myself The mail came on day 4 and I ripped open the package My initial plan was to rush upstairs rip the face off the cardboard packaging then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my DVD player However I stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the filmbr br By the time it was over I was cool as a fool in the pool The Shepherd is certainly one of my all-time favorite direct-to-video films ever and makes Derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is Sure some of the fights ran a twee bit short but they were still VERY awesome The shootouts were superb as was Scott Adkins who SHOULD have been the villain unlike the forgettable Steven Lordbr br I highly recommend this flick Seriously
Van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books From the setting of Mexico to the five star fight scenes this movie was amazing The film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of Mexico Ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of Mexico into the united states of America (USA) Van damme and Scott Atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain Although this film wasnt as good as until death but it still gave the actionacting and the film a five star look I always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better keep them coming van dammebr br Watch this film if you enjoyed films like - Until death The hard corps and second in command
This movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors I only knew about it because I am a long time Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and I always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (Derailed Second In Command) they are This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme Scott Adkins and the final one of them together The editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but Isaac Florentine can definitely film a good fight scene I too am happy that Van Damme has been acting better lately (In Hell Wake of Death Until Death) but with the good acting came less martial arts In The Shepherd Van Damme proves that he still has it
I like the shepherd! Sure the acting wasnt good but the fight scenes were nice Van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins The story was average A Texas cop battles smugglers This movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action Van damme was never a good actor I think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2 If youre looking for an Oscar winning performance youre not gonna get it here but if youre looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you Scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movies in this movie are great Van damme delivers strong kicks and its good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies This movie is definitely worth watching if youre a van damme fan
I have not seen a Van Damme flick for a while pleasantly surprised he still has it looking older but tougher kind of like Sly becomes more rugged with age This is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the Van Damme movies I have missed over the last ten years I would like to see a good director put Van Damme on the big screen with a good plot Van Damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences the last movie viewed with Van Damme was Legionnaire that was a good flick as well In addition I looked in to Van Dammes early fighting history I too my amazement I realized he is the real deal very accomplished martial artist in his younger years
After 10 years it is finally save to say that our Belgian Action Star is back again I personally found this one to be even better than Wake Of Death which makes it his best movie in 10 years!! Okay it is not like his highlight years as Timecop Universal Soldier Sudden Death or even his best effort to date: Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors John Woo) The Action is good the story is exciting the dialogue is quite funny this one is better than expectedThe bad guys are awesome like in Hard Target and the fight scenes are old school Real fans know what to expect I must say I gave up on him but Van Damme is finally back More Please
Like Steven Seagal I also am a big Van Damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting careerbr br In this flick Van Damme assumes the role of Jack Robideaux whom is a cop that just moved to New Mexico from New Orleans to work as part of the Border Patrol Haunted by memories of his past it is up to Jack to put an end to a group of Ex-Navy Seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the US that killed his daughterbr br Overall I found this film to be very good Van Damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move The action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing Unfortunately Van Damme does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago regardless The Shepherd: Border Control is the 3rd straight solid film that Van Damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger projectbr br I definitely recommend this movie to a Van Damme fan or fan of action movies in general; The Shepherd: Border Control is a great movie not as good as Until Death but better than the Hard Corps Be sure to give this one a try you will not be disappointed
I thought that this was the most interesting film that JCVD has done in a very long time I loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film IMHO JCDV may really be on to something going forward A little more light heartedness some obvious homages to other films mixed in with some great fightsI would like to see more this style of film-making from him One of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a Desperado rip off I immediately saw the R Rodriguez connection also but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle cues from other films JCVD rocks!!br br Other stuff after reading other comments:br br No music in the dungeon fight? At first I didnt like that at first either but then I thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didnt expect Made it seem more realbr br I also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was stolen from the studio Directors are paid to do a job The studio is the boss and they want the product that they want Very few directors have absolute final cut on a film In this case JCVD is THE talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film I am sure he got a film that he was happy with I have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story PRESUMABLY the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film Everyone who saw it said it was a disasterthen JCVD and the studio re edited the movie This stuff happens all the time He also did see the final cut (which he claims he didnt) and his delicate genius ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut If this director was smart he should have taken credit for this one as it would have been his best
Its really good to see Van Dammes film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to C-grade flops Derailed and Second in command which were both tragic and not in a good way The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great actionfight sequences Its good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film Until Death had no martial arts in it at all!!!br br That being said this film is significantly inferior to Until Death which was a really good turn for Van Damme Until Death lacked the over-the-top action of most Van Damme films but was dark and gritty and Van Dammes performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film Still The Shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for Van Damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if youre looking for a film with a bit more story lineyou may want to skip this one!br br I do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on The only real problem I have with this film is the title; The Shepherd? I dont get it! I suppose Border Patrol just doesnt have the same ring to it without the word Shepherd in front of it!!!br br My rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but thats by Van Damme movie standards not in any other film categorybr br ie Its good for a Van Damme film
Wellits about time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller thats his best film in recent years The plot isnt too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex-marines as drug smugglers twist is cool But what makes this movie awesome is the fact that Van Damme is back to doing martial arts again His latest films have been more acting oriented but in The Shepard JCVD is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape There are some impressive fight scenes and Van Damme shows he can still pull out the old famous 360-spinning heel kick For being a low-budget action movie it does have good sets and great stunts Van Damme says some humorous lines and shows that hes improving as an actor Im glad hes back to dealing out some Van Damageive been let down by the lack of fighting in his recent films Scott Adkins is great in his role and Van Damme and him have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end Overall its one of Van Dammes better films and it will keep you entertained A must rent for JCVD fans Im just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like Bloodsport or Kickboxer Nok Su Kow!
I enjoyed it There you go I said it again I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more times Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 I think) delivering kicks that reminds one of Kickboxer If you like old school action and and explosions this is the movie to watch This is one of Van Dammes best worksbr br Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies get released theatrically where I live so I never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen
This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Dammes best Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre For further evidence check out Undisputed 2 Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched The Shepherd I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen Van Damme holds his own though and although he isnt quite as athletic as Adkins is he can still kick with the best of them All of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped I think Van Dammes characters motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit The reason he does is very cool but you dont find out until the very end There are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a Van Damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it aint character development Overall though this is a solid action movie that I recommend So run for the Damme border!
This film is good in its genre and that genre is naturally action with a littleaverage budget Looks like Van Damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him There is your basic bar brawl alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting Some basic drama but nothing too deep Isaac Florentine directs an OK action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it But the person who steals the show is: br br Scott Adkins How come this guy isnt a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star that I dont know Director Isaac Florentine has made a movie with Scott Adkins before called Special Forces (2003) which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic Another amazing Scott Adkins feature is Undisputed 2 Check this guy out and make a noise this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now!br br What else can I say about the movie? Its Van Damme stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work No Oscars here for sure but you already knew that But never the less it has a nice little town feel and I could find worse ways to spend my time So Im giving this a solid 7 out of 10 in its genre
After seeing Undisputed 2 I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentinebr br The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent flick (not Van Dammes best but definitely not his worst) There is some bad acting from VDs supporting cast but it makes sensebr br The storyline and plot has all been done before so its nothing new I mean this is Van Damme We dont really expect much of an amazing plot do we? So lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway: the fightingbr br Without giving anything away I thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done way better than a few of VDs recent movies such as Second in Command in which the entire end fight is HORRIBLE With Florentine behind the camera and if youve seen Undisputed 2 he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it A few of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of VDs older stuff which is what we all want to see The fights were good and i said hah awesome out loud a few times But I was hoping for just a bit more considering how good I thought Undisputed 2 wasbr br Something I found intriguing was VDs daughter in the film I thought wow shes kinda hot come to find out its Bianca Van Varenberg JCs real life daughter I have never seen her before so that was a nice treatbr br All in all this movie is not half bad Yeah the story has been done before but at least JC was attempting to make a good movie Next time though add more hand to hand combat! I think He still has what it takes to do another big budget moviehis acting has improved since hes been doing DTVs and he really is in great shape at 47 I dont know about you but Im one of the ones who thinks that most of his DTVs are actually good with the exception of Derailed All he needs to do is get back into bloodsport shape and make a martial arts movieand I think people would respond well even though hes not jet Li This movie is definitely worth the rental =)
Well it is a good movie However you have to admit that Van Dames movies havent been so great lately On the other hand if you are a hardcore van Dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes Also What i really liked is the music beautiful music am sure this will kill time if you are action fan As for Isaac Florentine the director of Undisputed 2 i dont think he did a good job as he did with UndisputedI cant wait when one day Van Dames movies hit the cinemas before the DVD Maybe one day:)br br In the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch this could make your hour and half fun
The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece The first sequel Jailhouse 41 was not quite as good in my opinion though its still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here but still hes managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (aka Scorpion) and this time shes out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back After escaping from pursuing police officers one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother The prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother () while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison But Scorpion doesnt like spending time behind bars and its not long before shes back to doing what she does bestbr br The film gets off to a great start as we see Scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail From there however the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films Thats not to say that there isnt still plenty of action - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in revenge mode and the film isnt exactly short on general sleaze Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and its another understated almost wordless performance Her screen presence is great however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film Theres a few surreal sequences not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point Overall I would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality - not as great as the original and slightly better than the second
Since the past couple of days Im really hooked on the Female Scorpion series and I keep hitting myself over the head because I waited until now  which is way too long  before purchasing the whole box set Beast Stable is the third brilliant effort in a row and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment Never before or after has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines settings themes and filming styles The original more or less qualified as a so-called Women-in-Prison flick (but already an atypical one) but you cant possibly categorize parts 2 and 3 as such since they hardly feature any footage within prison walls And the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well The first film was harsh and gritty whereas the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mainly melodramatic Dont let this last description discourage you however as Beast Stable still features more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage in spite of the dramatic ambiance The opening sequence for example is downright fantastic Sasori still a fugitive from the law literally chops her way to freedom on the subway when theres no other possibility than to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman that handcuffed her Her run through the city with the cut-off arm dangling on hers while the credits appear on screen accompanied by the familiar theme song is just pure and genuine exploitation gold! The story compellingly continues with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city but the poor thing simply cant escape her past or even new types of agony Sasori befriends a prostitute though without exchanging dialog and takes on a job in a sewing atelier Her own retarded brother (!) impregnates the prostitute while Sasori gets in trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network She cleverly prevents a thug from taking advantage of her body encounters a former enemy from prison and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she gets submitted to a barbaric abortion Meanwhile the one-armed cop continues to obsessively prowl the streets looking for retribution against Sasori Our multi-talented director Shunya Ito formidably criss-crosses all these story lines to a powerful wholesome and never once loses grip on the visual aspects or ingenious filming style Beast Stable features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine the editing is flawless and the exterior locations are effectively depressing Those who know Sasoris character a bit are aware that the film seriously lacks memorable dialogs but this always gets widely compensated with Meiko Kajis wondrous on screen charisma and menacing grimaces Theres very little sleaze apart from the aforementioned incestuous sub plot but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words In fact I think part three might just be the greatest (or at least my favorite) one of the series so far My only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is regarding the ridiculous sounds one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked up in a cage That bird sounds like a ventriloquists dummy with stomach cramps
After finishing the Zero Woman series I was looking forward to the Female Prisoner Scorpion series; both based upon comics by Tooru Shinohara Unfortunately I was not able to see them in order as this is the third in the seriesbr br It starts great as The Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) is escaping from the police Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) did manage to get a cuff on her but she proceeded to cut off his arm and get away If that isnt bad enough later on a dog digs up the arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treatbr br Scorpion might as well go back to prison as life is no picnic on the outside First a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she doesnt put out; and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of Tanida But they dont hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeancebr br Soon they are dropping like flies Some certainly deserved it for wearing garish outfits with shirt collars so big they went all the way to the shoulder The madam (Reisen Lee) turns herself in to avoid getting killedbr br The police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer Shes in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) has been supplying her with food (The story O Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting but only incidental to the movie) They try to burn her out but this is The Scorpion and she has some unfinished businessbr br Not the usual mix of sex and violence this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout
Theres hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima(Meiko Kaji) Female Scorpion and a dangerous group of thugs(including their sadistic head pimp and his equally repellent lady) operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist does just that Hell hath no fury like Scorpion and a determined detective Gondo(Mikio Narita) seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her will do whatever it takes(and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts)to catch Nami Nami finds an ally in hooker Yuki(Yayoi Watanabe) who provides her a temporary shelter Yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job and must take care of him(in a disturbing revelation regarding incest she also provides his sexual needs!)she in actuality keeps him locked up in a room while working the streets! Meanwhile Nami is targeted by a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her own(she works as a sewer) and he threatens to turn her into the authorities(Nami was an escaped convict who fled a subway from the cops)if she doesnt supply him sexual favors His wife dumps a tea kettle of boiling water all over his face and body resulting in death & the prostitution clan come looking for Nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization Thats when Katsu(Reisen Lee) the pimps lover and confidant realizes that the one responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former inmate of hers Scorpion Subduing her with an injected liquid drug placing her in a bird cage(!) Katsu embellishes in her imprisonment What ultimately fuels Namis rage is watching a prostitute die outside her cell a victim of a forced late-term abortion left to bleed to death Finding a scalpel clutched in her hand(from the operation room) Nami will break free from the cage and prey upon each member of the clan responsible for the hookers death The series of scalpel murders provide Gondo with an opportunity to catch Nami and hell trap her in the underground sewers below the city but can he catch or kill her? Especially if Yuki comes to her aid?br br Trust me when I say there was no shackles binding director Shunya Ito or his film-making team because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION:BEAST STABLE is yet another perverse deranged and ultra-violent entry in the very entertaining series Equipped with fine production values and a visually stylistic talent for capturing all of the madness in imaginative ways Ito pulls you right(or he did me)into the twisted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on screen When you have a protracted opening credits sequence where your anti-heroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a mans severed arm handcuffed to her the viewer has to know what theyre in for! The incestuous sub-plot is simply bizarre(and its shot in a soft-core way with the retarded brother humping his numb cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead!) and the entire abortion sequence is rather hard to sit through But the abortion angle as disturbing as it is provides motivation for Namis revengedespite Namis imperfect ways and her criminal nature you would rather see her take these cretins out than vice versa Interesting angle with Detective Gondo as well Gondo is willing to break the rules and he becomes a force-of-nature towards anyone who stands in his way of capturing his mortal enemy His fate at the end visiting another enemy of Namis in an isolated cell while she looks on perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous yet so entertaining The scalpel murders is a montage of slumping scumbags in various places the blades protruding from flesh with Nami leaving the crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan out in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances While the film is essentially a comic book adventure theres a sadness that permeates and few characters come away without flaws I imagine many will walk away from this scoffing at how unrealistic FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION:BEAST STABLE is(specifically how Nami is able to escape capture time and time again accomplishing her goals of revenge paying back all those who have wronged her) but I looked at it as a violent action cartoon much like the later 80s films and enjoyed it for what it was As always this film features some beautiful Asian actresses and some colorful heavies Meiko Kaji almost always reservedquiet yet chilly staring down her enemies with violent intent is in fine form(in more ways than one)and Reisen Lee as her cross-eyed repugnant adversary runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized contemptibly abusive foe worthy of psychological torment(when both are in prison Namis ways of torturing her are sweet) My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot but is so wonderfully wrong features a dog discovering Gondos rotted severed arm walking through a street eventually finding a resting place to chew on it!
The third and final Female Prisoner Scorpion film directed by Shunya Ito The series star Meiko Kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment Grudge Song directed by the capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter) The original Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion is one of my all-time favorites The sequel Jailhouse 41 is nearly as good Its generally considered the best of the series and I might agree I think if it ever gets a better release on DVD (the original by Image is very poor) Beast Stable in my opinion is nearly as good as FP701 Its much slower much more contemplative It has its share of violence and nastiness but theres more focus on the story and the characters Sasori (Kaji) eludes detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off  and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed!) and hooks up with a freelance prostitute Yuki Yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofy-looking madame with a cage full of pet crows What really surprised me is how sad the movie is Yukis story which is never resolved it heartbreaking The images are startling and Itos direction is masterful Its too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the FP701 series This is an awesome film
Many consider BEAST STABLE to be the last of the true FEMALE PRISONER films as it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito and is followed by one other film (GRUDGE SONG) by a different director I have not seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but soon will) so I dont know how it stacks up to the previous FP films - but it will be interesting to see The way BEAST STABLE ended didnt really leave a lot of room for another predecessor - but I guess Ill find outbr br This entry has Scorpion on the run from the cops where she hooks up with a street-hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child (oh yeah - thats no liegotta love these sleazy story lines) Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival but (as she is so good at) ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that wronged a few of her hooker friendsbr br I agree with some other reviewers that this one is a little slower at points and more serious then the previous two entries The story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times but a lot of these 70s era pinky films are - and I still love them BEAST STABLE is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing - but I thought it strong in other areas - storyline cinematography some good sleazeetcDefinitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing or who have enjoyed the other FEMALE PRISONER films810
Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable the third in the series is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze Closer in tone and subject to a Nikkatsu violent pinker than other Scorpion entries it is stunningly photographed directed with lurid enthusiasm and populated with a rogues gallery of villains and degenerates Shinya Ito the director of the first installment returns for this surreal fable which begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the Tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist She takes refuge in a red light district where she befriends a prostitute who is first seen seen having incestuous intercourse with her brother (who ends up impregnating her) Scorpions desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose She is beaten sexually assaulted and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in the villains lair I loved everything about this hypnotic nihilistic and emotionally touching movie It is the superior of the three first Scorpion films and features one great scene after another I cant recommend it highly enough
The third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant Exploitation movies and the third masterpiece in a row Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya aka Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable (aka Sasori: Den Of The Beast where I live) of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects but that equals (or arguably even surpasses) them in brilliance The entire original Sasori series with the wonderful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute highlight in WIP cinema and all of the films especially the first three uniquely combine Exploitation and Art-house cinema like no other movie does Beast Stable is the third and second-to-last Sasori film with Meiko Kaji the last one to be directed by genius director Shunya Ito and in my opinion the greatest of them all The first film Joshuu 701-gô: Sasori of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of Exploitation cinema and simply THE Definition of Exploitation-Art In the equally brilliant first sequel Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô Ito added more surrealism and symbolism The third Sasori film Beast Stable keeps up the surrealism (allthough not quite to the same extent as the second) and features even more social criticism than its predecessors Topics like poverty forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie br br This third Sasori film is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the generally brilliant cycle (to me its this one with the first one as a close second) Once again Best Stable is both very artistic and very Exploitation-like The visually stunning film features an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again as well as sequences of enormous surrealistic beauty The stunningly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again brilliant in her role of Nami Matsushima (aka Sasori) I absolutely worship this wonderful actress and Im sure Im not the only one to do so The rest of the performances are also great especially Mikio Narita is great as a police Inspector who is obsessed with catching Sasori The musical score is the same throughout all three films with Urami-Bushi sung by Meiko Kaji herself as the main theme which is great since the score is simply put pure perfection As its predecessors Beast Stable is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation-Art that no serious lover of film can afford to miss The entire Sasori-cycle ranges high on my personal all-time favorite list Beast Stable is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all! 1010
I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and its follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701s Grudge Song}) for some time I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series After just watching this film I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three br br All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito What is great about them though is that even though they all feature the same lead character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji) they are each vastly different from the others br br The first movie (Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical Women In Prison movie But the character of Scorpion is very intriguing - very reminiscent of the anti-heroes of many spaghetti westerns And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material br br The second movie (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a real tour-de-force Not so much a WIP movie as the bulk of the film has Scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the lam br br This movie (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito This one plays out as much more of a crime drama Once again our heroine is on the run But this time out she has managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life (relatively speaking anyway) She gets a job she finds a place to live she makes a friend on the outside But of course everything has to unravel eventually FPS: Beast Stable has a more straight-forward story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors But I found it to be engaging from beginning to end And dont worry: there is still plenty of depravity to go around in this movie! But I think these movies transcend most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a straighter tone rather than being used exclusively for in-your-face shock value Yes there were definitely moments in this movie where I cringed mightily But I didnt feel that they detracted from the value of the story (well maybe a time or two) One thing I have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued build-up of Scorpions mythos With this entry character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two We get to see that she is much more than just a stone-hearted vengeful badass!br br As I mentioned earlier in this review a fourth movie followed It also features Meiko Kaji as Scorpion but had a different director Without giving anything away I want to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary The fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mind-blowing trilogybr br I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out-of-the-ordinary films FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a stand-alone piece (as can the first two movies) but I would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so
I loved this show I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show Wasnt the shop located like right on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years I lost touch and wish I could reconnect now as adults Anyone know where she is now? I wish they would put it out on DVD I seriously doubt that since I think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place They just dont make shows like this anymore do they? I wonder if it would still hold up in this day and age Do you guys know anyone that could burn DVDs of the show they taped on VHS? Id be willing to pay(within reason)
Im sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people The series started off very good and after the first season it wasnt that goodbr br People tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end This is not good to do you should look at the total not the end result It is sad that a lot of the usual characters died but damn we had a lot of nice NEW charactersbr br Please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series the plot Please do understand that I didnt like it when Boone died when Augur died but well it needs to be done Can you imagine that everyone keeps living the whole series when they are in a lot of danger all the time? Come on face it if they didnt die they would be invincible In this way you will always keep the tension will he survive will he die? I do realize that people attach their selves to characters I do that too My favorite character was Augur the one who could get into every computer he wanted He was the one who was mysterious he could do things with the computer no one else could dobr br I wish to make one statement to all the people who vote negative does a series which started so good deserve to have such low rating? Should we look at the final season instead of the total? Should we not see how good the series was when it started? Should we not see how much we enjoyed it?
Believe me I wanted this series to work but the early departure of Kevin Kilner dealt a near death blow after season one Robert Leeshock just wasnt right for the part and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as lead but the series just got too messy and confused at that point I dont know what happened in Season Five what a mess Sometimes its time to drop the red cape and just stick the sword in the bull if you know what I mean The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict If not for their talents and well-written dialogue they would have been two weird bald man-chicks in a B-movie seriesbr br If only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by SyFy
Ok everybody agreed on what was the best season The first And killing off Boone was a bad desicion Also killing off others was bad Blame the directors and writers for it Bad boys BUT I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys I cant help it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season Still its easy to accept Liam as the new main character if you are over Boone He is really mysterious The thing that shocked me most was when Lilli was written out of the story and how That was something she didnt deserve! And what do we get? Some blonde chick called Renee with absolutely no character! But these Taelons stay mysterious and you stay wondering about theyre true plans till the end True Suspence The conversations between Zoor and Daan are sometimes brilliantbr br I understand that when you jump in on an episode from the 3th4th or 5th season you may not understand this show But when you watch from the beginning you just cant break loose!br br The acting is great the special FX are marvellous the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing Gotta see this guys!
Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched Earth: The Final Conflict was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 Seasons were well written and meticulously produced but somewhere along the way the Roddenberry touch was lost The loss of lead Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work The story involves the human race being visited by the Taelons an extra-terrestrial race who dub themselves The Companions After 3 years they have given earth new technologies helpful information about the Universe and more Many question their intentions here on Earth The main liaison on Earth between the races is Daan (Leni Parker) and he is to many the most trustworthy Taelon Questions arise: just why are they here? what are their goals is Daan aware of any suspected plots against the humans? There is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen) who utilizes his millions to investigate the Taelons By the end of the First Season things are going well Daan seems trustworthy Boone assists Doors in his investigation while working with Daan and the Taelons as a liaison In the middle of the 2nd Season things start unraveling and the once terrific and fascinating series spirals downward mostly because Roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers of whom his wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry was co-producer Still the first Season remains intriguing and fun to watch
Earth Final Conflict began like a new world a new vision from the creator of Star trek something fresh and unique full of great elements A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons) after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances But soon the character of Kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race Soon this resistance group begin to discover the sinister plans of the Talons using the humans in they own problems to survive they own destruction As I said before the show began great all was almost perfect including characters like Daan the original Daan was a big mystery because he seems to be a nice creature but at the same time he has his own evil plans manipulating some people in earth Soon came Zoor who wasnt bad but mark the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first big enemy of humans the incarnation of evil killing what could be something greater in Daan The first seasons ends in a great way with the dead of Boone and the second shows a new lead character (Liam) an hybrid being of human and Kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting powers He replace Kilner character in a good way so another storylines make it better including the conflict with the jaridians and the atavus But as I said lines before the evilness of Zoor begin to take more importance so the new conflicts were less realistic as the same Talons With time the whole great storyline of the alien roots of Liam where almost totally erased the same with other things of the previous seasons So when the final season began the original Earth Final conflict was just an almost forgotten dreams all the magic was missing just to let some vain intents to keep alive the show including the return of Kilner and Liam for a few episodes The final episode was just the evidence of how bad was the show with so many bad changes (to think the writers of some episodes didnt know anything about the first stories) it was one of the worst end I have ever seen in a TV show A real shame because Earth Final Conflict began like something unique fresh the stories the cast after watch so many show from USA something from Canada from the mind of the creator of Star trek was wonderful but in the end all change to worse I hope someday someone make a remake of this show of course using nothing from season fourth and fifth (except the cast everyone were perfect in his work) I still can dream in a better things
I remember this film fondly from seeing it in the theatre I recently found a copy on VHS & it held up to my memory of it While obviously not a big budget film the acting is quite credible & the scenery locales & costumes are very well done I only wish the Mammoths had been in more of the picture but when you see them they are also well done (remember SFX was done in those days without benefit of computers some poor devil had to actually put all that hair & fake tusks on real elephants!)the same effect was used on the elephants in Quest for Fire A better than average adventure film & a chance for the star Rod Cameron to play something besides a cowboy which he also did very well over the years
Interesting tale of giant mammoth elephants running amok in modern India Features transparent special effects-elephants dressed in shaggy coats sporting tusk extensions All this said we do have a good story and a fine cast at work and an exciting climax Its been said that the running time on this one was doubled when it showed in India-courtesy of Robert Lippert a master at padding Given a choice opt for the shorter version
I cant really criticize this film It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals Fortunately seeing it again years later it held up fairly well Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths No one believes him including his best friend played by Cesar Romero whose brother was among those killed And Rod Cameron was the only survivor The film was shot in India and has some good scenery The acting is on a high level I dont believe Rod Cameron Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor ever turned in a bad performance The mammoths when they finally arrive are fairly effective The ending also has an unusual twist particularly for a 1950s science fiction film Definitely worth seeing
The Jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie The only sci-fi part is the Woolly Mammoths living in the present daybr br Elephants are attacking villages in a part of India and these attacks are also killing people An expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this an American hunter blames these elephants are being frightened by Woolly Mammoths which are suppose to be extinct Nobody believes him at first but they do when the Mammoths appear at the end An earthquake finishes them offbr br The Jungle was shot on location in India and has a lot of nice scenery and some good Indian music including some songs which keep the movie moving along nicely The Mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks stuck onbr br The cast includes Rod Cameron Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Cat-Women of the Moon)br br The Jungle is worth seeing just for the scenery and music Very enjoyablebr br Rating: 3 stars out of 5
This was a surprisingly very good movie and an interesting idea However it was just a little bit disappointing in that the Twist was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie Whilst watching it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow There were superb performances there was never a dull boring moment so totally well worth watching this one It kept me interested right up until the end and for me there isnt many movies that can do that these days I highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie
This movie is a mystery Its not scary its spooky Youll probably jump at some points and for some of it youll be scratching your head to figure it out It unfolds its mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum Don He needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother and once Eve agrees to help him she completely opens up pandoras box and unleashes some very strange things including Malachi I wont go into Malachi but I thought the way that played out was complete genius I know movie buffs wont regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesnt have anyone very famous in it (Angelina Jolies brother was excellent but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition) but I do think the way the Malachi ending works is something to talk about Ive recommended this to my friends definitely worth the purchase or rental price
Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked! Now her book Breaking Dawn will not be first with that title Sorry Twilight fansbr br Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is medical student Eve who is assigned to interview psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolies brother) I suspected the twist and when she found out they both grew up in the same town I was sure of itbr br She kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared delusion going on At times she even acted like she had PTSD I really thought she was losing itbr br Well she wasnt losing it and when the end came I was floored My whole suspicion turned out to be wrong The twist was even more amazing than I believedbr br Overton was fantastic and the story is so much better than something Stephanie Meyer would come up with A must see
I caught this movie on local tv at about 4:30 am I didnt have expectations for it but after the opening credits I knew I was into something goodbr br There are situations that are left for your interpretation to find out what really happened so your attention is a key factorbr br The whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main characterbr br Your sub-conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinionbr br The technical aspects are very good Really good in fact Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and shes candy for the eye although shes most of the time in her white clothesbr br The fear factor is almost inexistent but theres plenty of mystery and tension to dig frombr br I would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers
When i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of Kelly Overton a young (and op and coming star) actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away she is amazing on screen and Im really looking forward to see what the future brings herbr br The movie it self was good in the sense that it let Kelly Overton do her stuff and take the wiever for a ride not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before but a good experience :) I would recommend this movie if only to see Kelly Overton this stage actor takes the screen by storm i give this movie a vote of 7 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the moviebr br And on a last note sorry about my bad English if this is gibberish for you :P plz ignore me
I saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed itAlthough there were several clues which I could realize after second time watching I was not able to awake the Dow-Dawn case Maybe this was my carelessnessThe subconsciousness of a woman was became concrete with personalizationLet me go outthe key sentence of the filmLet me go out from deep deep inside of your brain and we will both be freeA discrete film that forcing the limits of human conscious and brainAnybody who have seen the Machinist would realize the similarities with breaking dawnA man that could not escape from his conscience (again a psychological and an abstract concept)meets it in an human bodyAnd he will just be free of accepting and realizing there is no way of escapeAlso I want to mention about the performances of breking dawns stuffsIn spite of having not many experiences from actors and actresses to director all exhibited separately reasonable performance that have created a synergy which would increase the quality of the movie
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date this year it is one of my favorites The story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and I knew what would happen far too early Usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me (like The Others) but even knowing the outcome I still enjoyed it right up to the end Looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from Kelly Overton (Eve) Im afraid I was not Her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance (or characterization) by James Haven (Don Wake)  I hope we see more of him What a great little film highly recommended to all!
Saw the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in Oct 04  Mark Robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off big in his casting of Kelly Overton I had a strong feeling she came from the theater so I looked her up here and surprise Im right More Hollywood actors should follow her lead give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this For all the great things I can say about the film and the director (and there are many) I just cant stop talking to people about Kelly Overtons masterful performance Well be seeing a LOT MORE of her work no doubt br br Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on a daring film Get it out in the theaters so I can bring all the people I made want to see the film ASAP!
Wow Stella Shorts are great! Lots of patrons from The State and Stella the TV show I never knew that Stella could have gotten any better then they were on the TV show Stella or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella I also never knew short comedies could be any good My favorite ones were Pizza Racking Leaves The Woods and David arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin Greg I think over all that David was the funniest one Its funny when he doesnt make sense I like the music in the shorts Thats something I pay attention to a lot They always had good taste in music I wish they still made shorts either that or bring back there sitcom I hope they continue making good and funny comedy
When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought god this is horrible! But I loved Wet Hot American Summer So I knew something didnt make sense There was nothing left for me to do but search out for the Stella shorts which I had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there When I found them not only were my dildo expectations met but I found probably the greatest comedy scenes Ive seen in years The set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs Not only did I laugh my ass off the first time I watched them but continued to laugh harder when I watched them over and over again Its really a shame Comedy Central had the restrictions of cable television for the Stella series It would have faired much better on HBO or Showtime Their brand of humor cant be restricted by censors or popular culture Given even if it was on HBO Im sure the masses would have voted it canceled in a season or less but still it would have been fantastic Needless to say Im now in love with Stella and all its individual members Any Stella fan should check out David Wains site with all his short films They are equally as enjoyable as Stella itself So my hat goes off to Michael Showalter Michael Ian Black and David Wain for the unbelievable comedy they have made with Stella I hope to see much more of the troupe in the future
Hilarious and low-budget comedy at its best This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy Kids in the Hall Be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines filled with ethnic slurs and awful language Sex toys included!br br There should be more comedy like this around today This collection of sketches on one DVD will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts If you enjoyed The State andor Wet Hot American Summer get ready for some more glory If you are even considering this for younger audiences I would say that every child on earth should see this
If you were ever a fan of MTVs The State then these three guys will be familiar to you But even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like I did you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedybr br Born out of their stand up comedy trio Stella Michael Ian Black Michael Showalter and David Wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows and now after being available only to download from two websites they appear in pristine glory on one DVDbr br Think comedy sketch show sans censorship and youd be halfway there No stone of decency is left unturned But for those who like their comedy rude self-indulgent and bordering on puerile (and I mean that in the most flattering way) this is the DVD for you!br br I think its worth the money for the commentary from the two Michaels and David alone you cant help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and hurl abusebr br Fantasticbr br It must say something for the appeal of Stella that the likes of Julie Bowen and Paul Rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so fearlessly And you should follow their fine example throw preconceptions to the wind and prepare to laugh yourself sick
I honestly dont know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review as a result Im having a hard time describing these shorts Lets just say theres a good amount of gay sex some necrophilia some incest a fair amount of masturbation and several artificial members And I loved every minute of itbr br Not that its ALL crude humor It isnt They stray away from fart gags for the most part with the exception of one sketch entitled Pizza in which they use one very well They being 311ths of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on MTV called The State namely David Wain Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Blackbr br The trio go on adventures usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people people that are often actually more normal than they are The supporting cast is fantastic as well Paul Rudd Julie Bowen Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis and Sam Rockwell all make appearances in various sketches Theyre also joined by other The State alums like Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek The musical selections are also very well placedbr br Ive enjoyed these sketches over and over again but they arent for everybody as theyre pretty vulgar most of the time If you like clever humor that isnt afraid to push the limits of good taste then I highly recommend this If you liked Wet Hot American Summer (Directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or The State then you should really enjoy thisbr br I think it can currently only be ordered online Check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first and then find out how to buy the DVD
MISSISSIPPI MERMAID is a disturbing and unsettling examination of what it means to be in love with the wrong personbr br Truffauts directing is his usual outstanding work Although this is far from his best Deneuve is very very beautiful Despite the character she portrays
This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time The kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters A title like this makes a film flop even the French title is not much better Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve must have been enough to sell itbr br This is a long film but largely worth it Clearly influenced by Hitchcock we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride her rich husband a theft an identity switch and obsessive love The plot here is actually very good and takes us on an unexpected tripbr br The thing that works both for and against the movie is the focus on the relationship It is an interesting study in how these plot developments are played out in real life relationship with these two people Unfortunately this is what bogs the film down and makes it ultimately dissatisfying We do like films to have a real sense of finality and that is missing herebr br It was the case in many of her films that Deneuve became a canvas for Directors to play their fantasies out on and this time it doesnt work as well Messy here is the fact that the Director clearly just wanted to have Deneuve take her top off a few times Deneuve is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat br br Basically the script needed to be worked out better before shooting began to make this film tighter and shorter and to snap But Truffaut didnt snap did he? So - it wanders a bit but remains interesting
A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel Waltz into Darkness of the writer Cornell Woolrich It is a drama rather than a film noir which tries to send a message that love changes your own life ie your love to any person and the love you received from himher A wealthy man really changed his life for love while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her Belmondo played well as usual while a somewhat still young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent Frankly Bouquet was not so impressive in this film but less than that was the performance of Catherine Deneuve She was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then loverwife of Louis Mahé (Belmondo) For those who like to visit the world the film offers the occasion to see part of the Ascension Island and also Lyon city in France
This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar named Louis(Jean Paul Belmondo) Hes a single man looking wife then he advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named Julia(Catherine Deneuve) When she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected He marries to Julia but she suddenly disappearsA French eye private(Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julias sister and soon hes on the trail of his previous spouse Later Louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name In spite of the romantic delusion and everything Louis goes on enamored with his enigmatic wifebr br This film is a splendid drama plenty of betrayaldeception killing theft and Hitchcockian suspense Good performances by Jean Paul Belmondo as young proprietary of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful Catherine Deneuve as suspect heroine The film gets several references to the American cinema but Truffaut(400 blows) was a fervent moviegoer such as : Johnny Guitar Colorado Jim Bogart and HitchcockThe USA version was cut numerous minutes and deserves an urgent restoring and remastering Loosely based on the novel titledWaltz into darkness by Cornell Woolrich (Rear window and screenwriter of Alfred Hitchcock hour) who also was adapted in Truffauts The bride wore blackColorful cinematography by Denys Clerval(Stolen kisses) and atmospheric musical score by Antoine Duhamel Truffauts usual musicianThis is one of the best of his suspense movies along with ¨Farenheit 451 and Shoot the piano player¨ Remade by an inferior version by Michael Christofer(2001) with Antonio Banderas Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson full of erotic and lust scenes
The film is a joy to watch not just for the plot which is gripping but also for the superb performances of the actors Deneuve and Belmondo Though considered a flop on its first release it has become a critical success and it is clear to see why Deneuves acting style suited the film brilliantly she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something and her character in this film is I will not spoil it with saying what though it is divulged fairly early on Belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist I would recommend this film to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans It is a brilliant Hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does The film is approx 2 hrs so you feel that you have not been sold short Deneuve steals the show in this film and it is clear that at the time of making the film Truffaut was very much smitten with her A definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan 1010

In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know her When Julie arrives in the island to get married with Louis he waits for her in the docks but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to Louis They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her When Julies sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie that is missing Further he finds that the woman has cleared his bank accounts and left the island Louis and Julies sister hire an efficient private detective Comolli (Michel Bouquet) and Louis travels to France seeking the woman but he has a nervous breakdown in Nice and is submitted to an intense sleeping therapy in a clinic He recovers and finds that the woman actually Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve) works in the Phoenix Club Privé in Antibes and lives in the low-budget Monorail Hotel Louis breaks in her room and when she arrives from the club she tells that she was happy with him but her former dangerous lover Richard had blackmailed her Louis is still in love with Marion and escapes with her to the countryside But Comolli is chasing Marion in France accused of murdering Juliebr br La Sirène du Mississipi is a film-noir by the great directorwriter François Truffaut with an unconventional love story of passion murder and love that hurts The femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is astonishing probably in the top of her beauty and is delightful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic and the sequence when he escalates the wall of the hotel is impressive Catherine Deneuve makes this film worth and gives credibility to the passion and lust of Louis My vote is eightbr br Title (Brazil): A Sereia do Mississipi (The Mississippi Mermaid)
Ive slowly been collecting the films available on DVD of both Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut Both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time - fortunately Mississipi Mermaid is not one of thembr br Next to The Soft Skin coincidentally staring Deneuves sister (the late Francoise Dorleac) this would have to be my favourite Truffaut filmbr br As well as directing Truffaut also wrote the screenplay Something that always strikes me about Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story -- one could almost call it naivetybr br Theres a scene towards the end of the film where Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon with the remains of the loot He rings the doorbell and Deneuve answers wearing a negligee In the time it takes Belmondo to reach their room from the street Deneuve changes into her dress puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep Its a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but thats Truffaut for youbr br Watching Catherine Deneuve in her films of the late 60s is indeed a sensory pleasure She is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch Incidentally for those fans there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasurebr br I disagree with previous posters I see nothing Hitchcockian about the film at all As for the look of it - i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60s It certainly gives films of this period a unique lookbr br Highly recommended for both Deneuve and Truffaut fans
This is one of the best films Ive seen in the last yearsBelmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic tricksterWords wont do this masterpiece justicesuffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the painhumiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it although its dressed as a film noir Forget that feeble remake with Jolie and Banderas see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty
I love this movie It is the first film Master P have ever done It is based on the story of his life It is low-budget but it is very good It shows how Master p grew up in projects in New Orleansbr br Not only did Master P start in this movie he also was the writer and director with Moon Jones The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party on it This movie shows how Master P goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him It also has many of The No Limit Records roster in this film You should buy or rent this filmbr br It is a great movie to watch is you like rap or is a Master P fan I will not spoil this movie for you Go get this movie as fast as you can and watch it You will like it
This movie was marketed extremely well When it was released in 97 during the middle of Master Ps fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves Thats why its no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250000 copies and still goinbr br If you are a fan of No Limit back then or even now check it out It has a few old school phatty videos and dont get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus Ice Cream Party So what I got to say to all the people who dont like Master P or No Limit Records dont watch it because it isnt for you and dont bother voting on it because youre only going to deter TRU no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes
Jewel Thief is one of those suspense thrillers in which the viewers are left guessing till the end who the villain is Suspense builds from the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are cleverly concealed clues in the film so that you can guess who is the jewel thief The story portrays that Dev Anand (Vinay in the film) and the jewel thief have identical faces But you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally come to know the villain There are many surprises and a lot of fishy stuff going on but there is time for romance and six melodious ever lasting songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar Asha Bhosle Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafibr br This film was also talked about for its songs videos Consider the teasing and counter teasing in Asman Ke Neeche Or the blocking of road by Dev Anand when Tanuja was going out with her friends in Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara Or the romantic Dil Pukare Are Are in the beautiful Sikkim Or the wonderful dance by Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat Add to it Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you will never forget this film for any reasonbr br Able acting by Dev Anand Ashok Kumar Tanuja and Vyjantimala and direction by Vijay Anand (Dev Anands younger brother) makes this one of the best loved Hindi films of all times even today
An excellent thriller of all time Vijay Anand excels as Director and Editor Performances by Dev Anand Vyjayantimala Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the minutest detail Cinematography adds to the mystery glamour and other requirements of the story as it evolves And to top it all music by Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable Yeh dil na hota bechara by Kishore Kumar Raat akeli hai by Asha Bhosle Rula ke gaya sapna mera by Lata Aasman ke niche by Lata and Rafi and Hothon pe aisi baat main by Lata again reaffirm Burman Dadas unique stature as a top notch composer with a style of his own
Jewel Thief is THE crime thriller of Bollywood and why should it not be? It is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in Indian Cinema Vijay Anand (Johny Mera Naam and Teesri Manzil) I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):br br 1 Vijay Anands direction 2 R D Burmans music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuris lyricsbr br Even if Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie it definitely has bond babes Helen Tanuja and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos) But our sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is anything but Bond He is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are He even flirts with Anju (Tanuja) trying to hit her romantic nerve just so that he can get employed in her fathers shopbr br Dev Anand might be in a double role - well I dont want to spoil your movie or else I would have told you That is what most of the mystery is about Dev Anand works in a Jewelry shop and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work - though is not or at least has a perfect alibi We wonder who did it is it Dev Anand as Vijay the person he claims to be or is it Amar someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is his look alike Comes Shalu (Vyjayanthimala) who even claims that he is her fiancé in a tense situation Dev Anand has to prove that he is Vinay and not Amar While everyone wonders if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar he is asked to remove his socks Amar we are told has 6 digits on one of his foot While we watch with bated breath the events that are about to unfold Dev Anand even finds time to joke br br The real life brothers Director Vijay Anand and Actor Dev Anand have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in Crime Thriller br br There are moments of Hitchcocks North By Northwest but the movies are very different Except for the confusion about who is who a treacherous female lead and lot of traveling there isnt a lot of similarity Dev Anand could very well be Amar in addition to being Vijay People have seen him they identify him where ever he goes There are too many of those people for this to be a fraud Finally Vinay thinks it is better to carry along with being Amar to find out what is the truth and it is a sad mistake He gets too deep into it only to be saved by the twists of Cinemabr br When I watched the movie as a kid I was definitely not amused the ending confused me completely Even now there are parts about the ending that I do not like but Id recommend this movie anywaybr br Even as a kid I enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer Yeh dil  - a definite loafers song in Kishor Kumars voice I could hear Rulake gaya  whole day long Ditto for Aasmaan ke neeche which is set under the skies of Gangtok (at least the story line suggests that) Raat akeli hai among the sexiest song to come out of Hindi cinema featuring Tanuja as the seductress Meri taraf dekho - Helens cabaret and we look at her Hothon pe  - now could there be any better thriller of a song than this As the song progresses we are more tensed than we ever were and the words hidden in Shalus lips add to it
Unlike Bond and other detective movies Alfred Hitchcocks hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage (and luck) would get out of it Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is Vijay Anands tribute to the master of suspense The tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himselfbr br It is the story of a common man Vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called Amar who in fact is a Jewel Thief Suddenly Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this Amar who remains one step ahead of him The suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme Just like Hitchcocks movies Jewel Thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of Sikkimbr br Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand Vijay Anand Ashok Kumar Vajyanti Mala Tanuja SD Burman Kishore Kumar Majrooh Sultanpuri etc etc are in their top forms This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India
Jewel Thief is a rare breed of film - completely noir in its story but nothing noir about the presentation A young man Vinay superbly played by a newly face lifted Dev Anand at age 40+ is estranged from his police officer Dad and finds a job in a jewelers store Soon random people come up to him and call him Amar Using just a few pithy moments the presence of a doppelganger is established Then a woman Shalini (Vyjayantimala) comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar he makes him take his shoe off and prove that he is not Aamr the 6 toed one The jewelers super cute daughter Anju (Tanuja) is completely enamored with Vinay Amidst all this confusion there is a Jewel thief on the loose and he is stealing at will Slowly we learn from Vinays encounter with a super hot night club singer (Helen!) that the thief is Amar the doppelganger Many many good looking women (Anju Mahendru Faryal) are after the hero The police force including Vinays Dad are completely befuddled Vinay is slowly falling for ShaliniShalu and her brother seems to bless the union The action moves to Sikkim as that is where Amars next heist is to occur The rest is for you to watch - the duplicate the girls the men who hang on to Vinays every word thinking he is their boss Amar the loving brother sister duo - nothing seems quite right and it takes the deft story telling (and direction) by Vijay Anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner The movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in Sikkimbr br I was not a big Vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent here although at her chubbiest She is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way but is best when she is sorrowful or dancing Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this film I so badly wanted her to get the man Dev was well Dev If he were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other) I would wonder who they had found to imitate him! Yet his style charm and charisma were unfailing In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara only Dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was simply awesome - Dada Moni did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history booksbr br SD Burman spun magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in a blood red rooster imitation dancing on a bar top) Aasman Ke Neeche Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera and my personal favorite seductive number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diyebr br If you are craving a great story with more twists than a pretzel wanting to be kept guessing yet amused and entertained - then go buy or rent Jewel Thief Better to buy it then you can go back and see it again with your buddies This one is a keeper
Nice movie At the begining i thought its a medieve detective kind hi-fi movie but the ending totally surprised me I guess the whole movie covers too many subjects each of them can be the main subjecteg avenge friendship and dream But it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them I think itd be a great movie if its built around the ending from the very beginingbr br 
Although I saw this movie in Korea in Korean and therefore did not understand the language images sure say more than enough From what I can make of it this is the story: Two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the kings guard One of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men The other has to hunt him down This movie is visually great The swordfighting is great And the movie has a gripping end I just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers And be released on DVD of course
I must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out It wasnt as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didnt develop the characters as well but it had many nice ideas Simple story: a elite soldier thought dead returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch The motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end You might need to watch it again to get all the connections right And me personallyI loved the end I could watch it over and over again Maybe a little pathetic but a real freedom fighter story People can be killed but not the ideas they stand for
After seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films I thought it looked very entertaining Before watching the movie i went on to IMDb to see what ratings and comments it received I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings Despite the hype I watched to movie and to my surprise I found it unbelievable br br The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing I havent seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time I really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond As reading previous posts about this movie not being epic enough or a lack of martial arts I could not disagree more This film is what it is its not Braveheart and its not Enter the Dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and actionbr br While Sword In The Moon isnt perfect (what movie is?) it still is wonderful and moving Just wait until the ending scene with the music and cinematography together its breathtaking I only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting
I saw the movie on its North American premiere (July 14 2004) at the Fantasia Festival I was slightly disappointed as I had been expecting a more epic ensemble cast movie along the lines of Musa the Warrior Instead the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters Still the movie was solid thoughtful and visually intriguing There were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties intrigue and blood versus the lighter more flamboyant martial arts sequences It almost seemed as though the filmmakers couldnt make up their minds about whether the movie was supposed to be a martial arts flick or a historical epic The story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations Is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be loyal to ones master or does there come a time when one must submit to the winds of change? Is there perhaps greater courage in leaving the old ways for new ones? How does one decide? These questions are raised in this movie and ironically there is the suggestion that the answer given may in fact be the wrong one!
Well SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea and despite the mostly negative responses Ive heard to it and the suspiciously tardy DVD release I couldnt help but pick it up - any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes :D Perhaps low expectations were an advantage because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyablebr br An assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne and the governments top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit This doesnt take particularly long but the answer is not one he wanted to hear Through prolonged flashbacks we learn why and the history of the swordsman and the assassin and of the revolutionbr br The film is typically melodramatic for a Korean film and resolutely serious in tone - no HK style comedy moments to be found here The story can be a little difficult to follow at first but all makes sense eventually The film goes a bit wobbly at the end but no worse than a Chang Cheh film might do and for the most part I found it enjoyable The production values are high with some good cinematography to capture it The fight scenes arent up to the calibre of the better HK wu xia films but perhaps theyre not meant to be - the fights are more realistic in that theyre less like choreographed dance routines but theres some wirework and occasional cgi that put the film in wu xia mode The film doesnt have the best cast unfortunately with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other Theres a young lady in the film that I dont think Ive seen before but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast - not just because you see her nekkid or perhaps it is :p The film lacks the charm and grace of the better HK wu xia films and perhaps the beauty too but I only wish HK would make them half this good anymore - TWINS EFFECT 2 does not give me hope that thats about to happen any time soon though Tsui Hark surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and cast SWORD IN THE MOON is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu xia by any means but its a whole heap better than ROMANTIC WARRIORS or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE - perhaps better than BICHUNMOO too though I did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing Obviously its nowhere near the wonderful MUSA but its a different affair altogether really SITM will probably get a second viewing within three years which is perhaps the best indicator of how much I liked it :) 710
Spawned by the same Monty Berman  Dennis Spooner partnership which produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) - the latter retitled My Partner the Ghost for the US market - Department S remains a classic example of the action-adventure series which the UK produced in bulk during the late 1960s Like those two shows its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality (Dept S also has a black superior) but its mostly facade: the launch episode Six Days is barely halfway through before Rosemary Nichols is called upon to parade around in bra panties and one (yes one) stocking in order to extricate herself from a dodgy situation Still its an interesting time capsule even if the appalling fashion sense of Peter Wyngardes character (which amazingly degenerated even further in the spin-off series Jason King) should definitely have remained buried
With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters Department S will be forever associated with Peter Wyngardes Jason Kingbr br Most people remember him as this camp flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of Austin Powers but that will do a disservice to the character: Hes far more nuanced than thatbr br Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end) he is egotistical (his appreciation of people is based on whether theyve read his novels or not) a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever Annabelle is rightand she often is Hes clearly a man having a mid-life crisis and drink drives butJason King is brilliant If Wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero it wouldnt have worked but he shows King often as a paper tiger led by his libido love of finery and prone to grandstanding (and it gets in the way of his detective work at times) but he has some of the best lines and put downs in TV history And by not playing him as whiter-than-white the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for itbr br Watching it again on DVD recently you get to see just how much depth Wyngarde put into Jason King
Created by Dennis Spooner Department S was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol based in Geneva created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle If a plane landed at Heathrow with no-one aboard if a man was found wandering around London in a space-suit if the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters you called on Department S to sort things outbr br Peter Wyngarde played Jason King a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases King caught the publics fancy and was later awarded a spin-off show He was ably assisted by American Stuart Sullivan ( Joel Fabiani ) and the delectable Annabelle Hurst ( Rosemary Nicols ) Unusually for a 60s show the department was headed by a black man - Sir Curtis Seretse ( Dennis Alaba Peters ) If the show looked and felt a lot like The Avengers it was hardly surprising It shared many of the same writers and directors! The colourful titles were designed by Chambers & Partners and are worth tuning in for alone As was the case with so many ITC series the music was composed by Edwin Astley His theme for Department S has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all timebr br Predictably the show looks a little sexist and dated now but dont let that dissuade you from tuning in Imagine a hybrid of Jonathan Creek and the Austin Powers movies and youve got Department S!br br Trivia Note: the episode A Small War Of Nerves features a young Sir Anthony Hopkins in a major role!
Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out Unlike these the hero(es) werent left holding an empty bag at the end They had usually tangible results It was also made clear that the good guys were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things Imagination wit acting which didnt always take itself too seriously  I miss it One reason being Im hard pressed to think of too many shows - BANACEK aside - which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat The writers excelled at setting up hugely improbable if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet for all that still made sense Too I agree with another reviewer that the Anabelle character was somewhat underused but when she was on screen it wasnt just for eye candy She was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it A rarity in those days Sullivan? If he wasnt in the Department hed be working for the KGB or CIA Hes that sort of coldly efficient ruthless type He knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done King? Its clearly a game to him One he excels at and which he parleys into ideas for the detectivespy novels he writes as his ostensible real job Hes probably the most fun to watch of the three although they all have their moments and often too I do agree that the eventual spin-off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original however
The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French Emmanuelle 2 This amazing woman did not go unnoticed and was soon cast as the lead in this all new Italian series where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer In this first installment Mae JordanEmanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals Much like Sylvia Kristels character Emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality This first film is basically about how she becomes the Emanuelle that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with Filled with gorgeous cinematography beautiful people and an intoxicating 70s score from the legendary Nico Fidenco this one is sure to please Those who enjoy the more story-driven style of the original french Emmanuelle should definitely like this as well The main story here being an interesting cat and mouse tale of a womanizing playboy who comes to the realization that he has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of him! Sexy fun and totally entertaining throughout; a soap opera to be sure but one with enough skin and general eye candy to keep the male viewers entertained For some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on DVD there has never been a legitimate DVD for this which is very strange The bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone gives this diamond of a film a proper release
You know youre watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you Im okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too Every time someone says anything it sounds like theres a narrator Either way this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe DAmato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot Dont get me wrong theres a fair dose of exploitation in this one but theres always room for more Laura Gemser stars and thats good because shes hot Its a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure but she still rules over her white counterpart You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of Often Every reason is good Every person is good Every location is good One scene even involves an entire hockey team whatever they are doing in Africa Sometimes the plot gets in the way and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people but theres enough Laura Gemser for all
Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot There she is met by a couple and other swinging couples They all stay at this huge very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool One night they have a pool party complete with real live native dancers Its very un-politically correct and very kitschy Later Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot which turns out to be in one of those drive-through stay-in-your-car safaris (albeit the photography is gorgeous) Throughout the film Emanuelle is going after every man she meets The photography is very well done in this film There are scenes with cascading waterfalls galloping giraffes and ancient ruins The film is worth seeing for the soundtrack by Nico Fidenco alone
The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft porn blockbuster (though it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got their first with Cesare Canevaris 1968 IO EMMANUELLE starring Erika Blanc) is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late questionably great Joe DAmato It is much closer in spirit to the now very dated Just Jaeckin film from 1973 taking a pokerfaced look at malefemale relationships questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy all in luxurious exotic surroundings Unlike DAmato director Albert Thomas (aka Adalberto Albertini who also made the hard to find YELLOW EMANUELLE actually a sexed-up version of MADAME BUTTERFLY !) does not present us with predatory drug lords snuff movie makers or rampaging cannibals making for an admittedly less sensational yet far more erotic viewing experiencebr br Photo journalist Mae Jordan aka Emanuelle (lovely Java-born Laura Gemser in her first lead role following bit parts as a Thai masseuse in EMMANUELLE 2 and an unspoilt native in Just Jaeckins portion of the rarely seen COLLECTIONS PRIVEES) flies down to Nairobi where shes to shoot the stills accompanying an article by noted British writer Anne played by the very Teutonic Karin Schubert with a butch haircut that takes some getting used to Anne shares an open relationship (remember when this was made) with her Italian husband Gianni (Angelo Infanti) meaning that both pretty much jump anything with a pulse Contrary to her subsequent reputation Emanuelle appears positively reticent compared to her heavy breathing hosts smoldering seductively at Gianni by way of foreplay until the exquisitely tantalizing pay-off Okay so she does make up for this lack of wantonness at the end when she does an entire male hockey team on the train I kid you notbr br Production on this sexploitation classic is quite impressive especially the superb cinematography And Nico Fidencos musical theme is a solid favorite of anyone with more than a passing interest in the genre a hilarious Eurotrash pop ditty (try to make out those totally nonsensical lyrics and have a full evenings worth of fun with the family !) that turns up throughout the entire film in every conceivable type of rendition from slow n sexy to hip-gyrating discobr br This is entirely Laura Gemsers show though Billed simply as Emanuelle (as was another actress on the same directors elusive EMANUELLE NERA 2) she lights up the screen from start to finish Not yet submitted to endless rape scenarios (as she would be once DAmato took over) she seems much more relaxed than in later films even smiling from time to time a rare occasion as anyone who has seen some of the ladys work surely knows A flawless Eurasian rather than as the title suggests black beauty (she hails from Dutch India now Indonesia and is actually quite close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel Emmanuelle Arsan) she projects a slightly passive even submissive sensuality which somehow detaches her from the depravity her morally corrupted cohorts indulge in Unlike the French film cheapskate moralizing is kept to a bare minimum almost thrown in as an afterthought near films end when Emanuelle tells Gianni that he hasnt lost her as he never possessed her to begin with I swear you could hear audiences of the Just Jaeckin version groan whenever Alain Cunys supremely irritating Mario showed up on screen as it meant we were in for too many minutes of halfbacks libertine philosophizing as an alibi for getting the divine Sylvia Kristel (now living in the Belgian capital of Brussels by the way) to disrobe the real reasons theaters were packed for years on end Gemsers later husband Gabriele Tinti (now deceased she has remarried) appears on the sidelines as the constantly drunk Scottish (huh ?) writer who forces himself briefly on Emanuelle amid the African ruins at some point but no real sex scene though
The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glorybr br Thats reason enough for mebr br She heads to Africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films Huge mansion near the jungle Hunters staying around for parties when they arent out hunting zebras And said parties becoming drunken orgiesbr br All the high society types in the Emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes And Emanuelle beds most of thembr br Joe DAmato did NOT direct this one He just ripped it off and used the same cast(s) And did anyone notice the subliminal sexual images at the gas station? And why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes? br br Coherence? Hardly any BUT GODDESS GEMSER IS BEAUTIFUL
I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X Luckily my hopes have came true You got a whole bunch of action comedysilly comedy and surprises I think the newcomer Edison is really a hit in the movie but I really find Sams Alien stupidly annoying with English Although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue the action always keeps it strong The action set-up is much stronger than the 1stbr br This movie is getting more of an American feel since 60% of the movie is in English from the Cantonese This movie will not disappoint you I recommended this for young uns that care about pure action-packed funbr br 
I think this movie has got it all It has really cool music that I can never get out of my head It has cool looking characters IS REALLY funny(you know the kind that youll crack up on the ground and youll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks)Despite the bad acting bad cgi and bad story(about cops going after a robot) its really cool Its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more timesbr br There are so many funny parts like when Kurt was trying to get Edisons attention and gave him the finger and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball On that part I kept saying Remember Remember?to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened There was also a really funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there(just before they fought) and Kurt was talking about his Strange dream and how he was Superman I LOVED that part although it has been a while since I saw it so I dont remember that part Everything the actors said were funny like how Kurt says I worship you like a GOD! to the robotbr br Although there was some bad things in all it was a GREAT movie Man I cant stop laughing I wish I had that movie );
Gen-Y Copssince I heard of the film being in release I have been wanting to see it because I loved Gen-X Cops I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse didnt return and B) too much slapstick Nevertheless I enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film but it is good in its own waybr br Stephen Fung returns as the ultracool ladies man Match who has a steady girl in Oli (NOTE: Where is Haze?) and Sam Lee returns as the insane Alien (this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of English!!!!) The real star of the film is newcomer Edison Chen He makes a great replacement for Nicholas Tse asEdison I also enjoyed Paul Rudds performance of Agent Curtishe seems to be the tough as nails smartmouth FBI Agent youd love to hatebut soon youd like his characterbr br The fight scenes are a lot better in this oneeven though there are very few but they are great courtesy of Jackie Chan stuntman Nicky Libr br Look for a cameo from Ron Smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with Match Smoorenburg also is the stunt double for Ruddbr br If you liked GEN-X COPSyoull love GEN-Y COPS!!!
This film is great All the hi-tech machinery and technology is mind-boggling It is packed with action humour and not to mention guys You will want to see it again and again Very very funny Also it has a very unique plot which is unpredictable You wouldnt want to miss out on it
I am having a holiday in hong kong now and i just saw gen y cops at the cinema what can i say it was sooo cool!!br br Everything you could wish for was in it! Basically just see it if ya can Im gonna get my friend to send me the vcd when it comes outbr br Only bad thing was the dodgy American style of talking employed by some of the hl actors like Edison Whats up my man?! but it did add even more humour to iy hhehebr br See it especially if ya like any of the following geners: HKfilm action comedy sci fi! SEEITMAN!! Edison did a good song for it too so download it Edison Tse - Heroes
This is a well done action movie There are plenty of fight scenes the acting is convincing (for this genre) and RS1 is awesome I dont know why people feel compelled to trash RS1 I thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great The plot was acceptable for a martial arts moviebr br Having said that I must tell you Richard Sun is one of the worst actors from Hong Kong I have ever watched At least RS1 had the right idea by killing him Now for all of you who thought Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actorhe wasnt meant to be taken seriously! I have just had the pleasure of watching Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same character the same way!br br Now please all of you guys who watch highly reviewed Oscar winners: DO NOT JUDGE THIS IS A THINKING MANS MOVIE! IT ISNT SUPPOSED TO REQUIRE THOUGHT! Just meant to be enjoyed thats all I hope they make another soon
Genius or utter madness? That depends on your interpretation of this film I responded to it on the level of a self-aware cop-movie parody and I sincerely hope that was the intention as I dont see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark a departure for Rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? Some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? I think not! br br With the cheesy almost awkward acting low budget FX and zany over-the-top action set pieces it all kinda evoked that old TV show Sledge Hammer for me! HILARIOUS!!! :-)br br Of course I may have totally interpreted the film wrong If it was in fact an attempt at a straight action movie then it was certainly an amusing failure!!br br Watch with lots of alcohol and some mates!!! ;-)
this movie is certainly worth a watch its full of action its also humorous youll laugh until your stomach hurts if you watch this movie this movie also includes lots of hi-tech things hence the name gen-y i recommend you to watch the prequel of this movie which is gen-x
This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premisebr br The comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple; Stan Laurel not wearing any pants Laurel plays a Scottish naive young person who arrives in America in full kilt For some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on Philipbr br Its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while Although the movie definitely still has its comical great moments it at the same time is also far from the best of the many Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts that are still around The movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest although it definitely is most fine executed all for most partbr br Great good clean fun just nothing too remarkable or memorable allbr br 710
This is one of L&Hs shorts most frequently cited as the first real L&H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features J Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip whom hes never seen At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way hes behaving during his medical exam but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow hes supposed to be greeting He has been told that Philip is a good boy but he has one weakness--women Mumblethunder and Philip set off to go home but their journey there is continually interrupted by Philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman then chasing after the woman Huge crowds gather each time this happens not so much because hes chasing skirts but because Philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt) Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailors shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants but Philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts There are lots of laughs all around Its also nice to see a short like this because the boys arent exactly the characters we know and love Ollie is pretty much his usual character but its such a joy to see Stan acting so differently from his usual man-child character It shows he wasnt a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance With a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches
Stan Laurel regarded PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP as the first true L&H film THE SECOND HUNDRED YEARS was the first official L&H film but this was the one where Stan completely resigned himself not only to performing (he had signed on with the Hal Roach Studios as a director and gag-man before certain situations - among them Oliver Hardys accident with a leg of lamb leading to Stan having to replace him; and the extra money that performing would provide for himself and his new wife Lois - brought about his historic return to performing as well as writing directing editing and involvement in other areas of production) but also realised the fact that he was part of a team that worked well together This therefore is an historic and very important film in the history of comedybr br It is also a surprisingly funny little silent film; rather different from what Laurel & Hardy would become known for and from what they are more immediately associated with today The characters of Stan & Ollie do not appear - Scottish Stan Laurel plays the nephew of Oliver Hardy a respectable man about town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange-looking fellow with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls There are some very funny moments in this well-made charming little movie and the performances of these two Kings of Comedy are spot-on - watch Stans little scissor-kick and smile that says Well waddaya know? when he sees girls or the hair-ruffling scene at the airport for instance Hilariousbr br Watch this film if you can with backing music from The Beau Hunks Orchestra (available on the VVL video releases) which enhances the 1920s feel and is very very pleasant to listen to Its a brilliant and underrated little film which is why I said it was surprisingly funny
Transcendental sophisticated incisive emotive powerful I could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence and still I would feel they were insufficient All I can really say is that I am infatuated with this film Applause to Krzysztof Kieslowski Zbigniew Preisner Irène Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant May Rouge live forever
What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons (without becoming unrealistic) manages this beautiful movie perfectly well (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful La Double Vie de Veronique of the same director and with the same beautiful actress) This is a REAL movie that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story masterfully directed excellent main actors masterful cinematography Ive just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time and I still think its one of the best Ive ever seen And if you should be unhappy with the ending of White - Red puts an happy end to the whole trilogy
A wonder My favorite film The most important film about relationships ever made Brilliant writing Magnificent directing Image systems and symbolism that leave you thinking about it all days weeks years later Wow A truly great work of art
This movie is not only about feelings and human emotions it is also about everything that could be but its not Poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying but this movie is delightful to be watched Not to mention the amazing Irène Jacob a great actress in France - one of the best actually When the movie ends you can only feel sorry After all when something is truly great we want more (Well for another great movie by K Kieslowsky with Irène Jacob we can always watch La double vie de Veronique)
They both believed that a hidden sentiment has unified them This certitude is beautifulbut the incertitude is more beautiful They believed that they had never been metNothing has happened between themBut those roadsthose stairsthose corridors for all that time they could have been met Although it did not mean to beit was a swan songTwo young peoplewho are neighbors and have never been metare found in the same placesthe same timesdoing most of the times the same thingsThey finally meet in the dramatic and very brilliant end that brings them togetherMeanwhile the woman has met an old manTheir relation is brotherhood-likeHe told her his lifeIt was like the young ones but with better prospectivesThe young man can do whatever the old man has not livedHe can be happy with the woman The ending is exceptionalThere is a ship wreckThe only survivors are the heros of the Three colorsThe man and the woman finally meetThe scene lasts a few secondsThe woman there looks like the photo she had taken for an ad in the beginning of the film;sad in a red fondBut every start is only the continueThe book of the life is opened in the middle
Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowskis trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together I am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories let alone all three Everything seems to fit together so precisely all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements Simply brilliant!
Most of Kieslowskis films seem like puzzles to me meant to expand mind and soul The characters are not very believable are idealized are schematic Nevertheless the way Kieslowski presents their winding ways through life their complicated interaction with others with the universe with chance or destiny makes me understand faith makes me (want to) believe in God That at some point it all has a meaning if not to me then certainly to someonebr br Trois couleurs and especially Rouge comes closer to making me touch feel experience the truth the meaning than perhaps any other of his films The only problem being the paths of the puzzles explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable There is still plenty of joy to be had here It is like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect and it delivers sometimes with a newly found bouquet which might come from aging - either the wine or yourself
Rouge is part of a trilogy but very much stands on its own It isnt a sequel of any sort The very end which I wont divulge ties the three films together but not seeing the other two doesnt make it too confusing br br This film amazes me because it is so spare so subtle and simple but is as effective emotionally and intellectually as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama Kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny Both themes are loosely woven together in the story The film is very much a puzzle but the message is pretty straightforward: Everything happens for a reason Love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it The title Red refers to the French flag where red represents fraternity or brotherhood The color dominates the visuals of the movie I tend to think of it as representing love or passion or the blood of life Its great when a film allows the freedom to do that ;)
Theres a spartan unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic encumbrance telling us HOW were meant to be feeling; in Blue everything was overtly sad (sure powerful as hell but still); in White it was delightful whimsy But there are no such emotional clues or cues for that matter in this one Its as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle-dazzle embelishment I think thats what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three but finally the most transcendent and redemptive Never has remorseless unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful
Valentine Dogkiller Dussaut and Joe The Judge Kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of Geneva! Thrill as they put the kibosh on international heroin smugglers Polish fugitives peeping toms philandering girlfriends renegade dogs and litterbugs who are too lazy to bin their recyclables Dont be fooled by the deceptive Miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious art house flick This movie is 100% action!
I use IMDB very much Mainly reading comments of other people about movies I´ve or not seen I´ve thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and the way I look a movie I think I have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94 when I saw it in the theatre for the first timebr br I feel Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time And I think this is his best one It was his last one I was very sad the day I knew he has died because sure we lost the chance to get something more from himbr br RED is just the best Kieslowski + incredibile performance by Trintignant & Jacob + cinematography by Sobocinski If you haven´t seen it LOOK FOR it!!! If you have just come back to it!!br br Red: just a masterpiece please forgive my poor English! reader
The greatest movie everbr br Hows that for a contention? However if we look at it through purely cinematic terms it is clear that Three Colours Red is a masterpiece It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time As a discussion into human morality Three Colours Red works on an intensely metaphysical level with a depth that none can match Blue went almost as far into the human psyche but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat White forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this in retrospect was better still but still not quite there Red however is the real thing What he expresses in this movie is an expression of what it is to be human In fact what he expresses is _how_ it is to feel human It forces us to examine up to the minutest detail the very nature of our souls of our ethical selves In Red one may find meaning on one of its several levels On the first level Red achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we could have no trouble in calling Red an exceptionally entertaining story However the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie It is as if Kieslowski is saying: Ceci nest pas la réalité In effect in pursuing a humanistic goal Kieslowski can also challenge reality It is a trick that Kieslowski has been attempting since Le Double Vie de Véronique but not until this his final film did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate philosophy and circumstance The actors and actresses too appear to be at the mercy of a greater power Valentine (Irène Jacob) is aptly name for she seems to represent an almost pure love Meanwhile the idea of first impressions is challenged by Jean-Louis Tritignants Judge Kern a cantankerous man who by the end becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy a power which he could only achieve through Valentinebr br We have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures In fact films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature It wont happen of course but at least we have the power to view this film knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we cant define but all possess A synopsis of this film read: A film about a woman who runs over a dog Well it isbr br Isnt it?br br -Simon Huxtablebr br 
This is a classic continuation to Bleu the likewise excellent film with Juliet Binouche as a main star moreover she is a cameo appearance here in Rouge just for a second at the very end But this film truly red and very sweet although very sad is a real winner The main heroine played by ever great Irene Jakob is a successful photo  fashion model She leads a full active life only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike who is in England By some lucky chance she gets friendly with the old Judge who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors The story starts to weave even further and we see him in court being almost universally condemned for his pastime She is the only one who feels sympathy for him for his cute doggy Rita and her pups and for all the people who surround them We also witness the break-up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal But the film is not about this even It is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people far and near When she sails to England on a ferry with that lawyer as a chance fellow-passenger as well as that earlier mentioned Binoche who starred in Bleu the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of The Judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived She did and still we feel very heavy at heart Mr Kislowski managed to draw a grand subtle story about the solitude misunderstanding secrets and pain Deep dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely Brilliant film
In my analysis of Trois couleurs: Blanc I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of Trois couleurs: Bleu I think its the same with this film This time its not because of a tragic comedy-element but much more because of the main character Valentine Although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous she manages her life with lightness and optimism it seems to me that she might be Kieslowskis image for a carefree youth The opposite seems to be the judge who is very pessimistic a grumpy old man who experiences big loneliness In my view Valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other the judge is just much older and has experienced many more disappointments They share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one Finally I would like to stress Irène Jacobs performance she rounds off the run of amazing female contributions to the Three Colours-trilogy
Well every scene so perfectly presented Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scenebr br Well while I was watching this movie I remembered watching Amilie Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch These movies are both based on a same plot line But both of them are Perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their ownbr br Red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s And I am still thinking about itbr br The story is great and the ending is a bit funny I was laughing in the end scene Well funny how this three movie Red White and Blue are connectedbr br All in all a great work of art A work of a mastermanbr br 1010
I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski He is Polish I am Dutch yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence Hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister so that as a social and cultural low pressure area Poland could play the role it did in WWII being critical yet Christian towards the Jews but often not less critical toward oneself There are innocence and guilt in Kieslowskis world view as the symbols in Catholicism: the White versus the Black Madonna In Rouge the Black Madonna is she who the judge fell in love with when he was a young man Flashbacks are magically-realistically intertwined with the present although totally coincidental such as the camera simply swinging to the other side of the street or the then young judges red jeep passing by the now young womans car after she accidentally hit his dog with it That we leaped through time in those same camera moves is what we grasp later His love was unanswered so that his life wasnt as he had planned it He lost his ability to love other people and animals Being a judge he feels he is actually spying on other peoples lives and when he retires he simply continues to do so spying on his neighbors this time The innocence and sense of righteousness of the younger woman (literally) accidentally getting into his life reinstalls his better judgment and it is because of her that he spontaneously confesses his spying behavior to his neighbors and the police accepting and even holding on to the stones consequentially thrown through his windows In the process history repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves although this time he is old and the woman not the same Kieslowski may have wrestled with this bit for the old judge is his alter ego and it is said he was infatuated by Irène Jacob Both women play the same essential role in his psychology of the one (!) who possesses his heart and soul and therefore can make him or break him even as an old man! It is as if the powers in the air are or God is bringing them together Coincidences are too coincidental to just be chance or even good luck There has to be some mystical supernatural or theological source influencing these unfathomably deep life-decisions The study book fell and opened at the page of the exam question is another example of this Or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman the wind outside the opera house suddenly slams the open doors and breaks the windows The gigantic picture of the young woman happens to predict the one on TV after the drowning accident on her Canal crossing trip These moments are effectively accentuated through the human voice of liturgy or what sounds like it (Van den Budenmayer)
Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmens everydays life? Is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions almost sympathetic towards judge Jean Luis destabilizing decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self-seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by himbr br Trois couleurs: Rouge is based on the concept of UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW ON THE WORLD The phone may be considered the main character of the story: after its performance in Dekalog 9 it gives in the beginning the encore to Kieslowskis onlookers followed step by step in its fast run across the world The director looks deeply into the faculty of communication of human beings without taking up a definite position about the ethical side of individual behavior Once again he points out to us the unpredictability of future events venting careful descriptions about strange courses and recourses of life separated from each other by a considerable number of years Inexplicable combinations oddly converging in a series of continuous and upsetting situations - Some books falling to the pavement - One of them opening casually on a fatal page predetermining the destiny of a future profession as in a past similar occurrence - Glimpses of daily life meeting fleetingly ideally joined by their fondness for the fictitious musician Van den Budermayer - Human fortunes marked by the most ill-fated coincidencebr br In this piece of work deserving to be seen with our hearts eyes instead of our minds ones we can witness a dialectic game between judge Jean Luis (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut (Irene Jacob maybe the sweetest actress of our times together with the beautiful Winona Ryder) in a generational conflict between the experience of a world-weary old man and the self-conscious immaturity of a nice girl on the point of facing the steepest path of her ascending way Kieslowski talks about dialogue tests between a disappointed human life and a youth unaware of her future between a spiritless misanthropist and a spontaneous girl full of good sense of unselfishnessbr br And the final parade when the damp odor of tragedy still lingers in the air with all the main characters of the whole trilogy in full evidence saved by an accidental stroke of luck thank to the providential script cleverly written gives us the extreme greetings of this movie master fully used up by his great passion for cinema Only a sense of bitter regret and emptiness is left to remind us the existence of a void impossible to fill GOOD-BYE KRZYSZTOF WE MISS YOU SO MUCH!
Master Kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993 the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today passing from Blue (a crafted visual masterpiece about a womans life) from White (A visual comedy movie about marriage) and finally arriving to Red (A masterpiece dealing with human interaction)br br While Im not going to spoil the move I can easily say Red is the best movie from the 90s decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script I have ever ever seenbr br The movie begins a little slow but finds its rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole moviebr br The performances are perfect sublime since the characters are completely realistic and theyre not clichéd in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesnt get disappointed seriously I believe Jean Louis Tringtignat deserved an Oscar nod at leastbr br The music from Zbiegnew Preisner is amazing its one of the best musical scores ever Piotr Sobocinsk Cinematography is also outstanding he got an Oscar nod for it (and deserved to win)br br Overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who dont Dont Miss itbr br How did the awful Pulp Fiction beat ed this masterpiece at Cannes is beyond my comprehension
Trilogies are very interesting Some go out with a bang (Lord of the Rings) some get progressively weaker (The Matrix) some get lost in obscurity (Blade Back to the Future) but some maintain the genius that seemingly ever-growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior Case and point: Three Colors Trilogy This chapter in the trilogy being the last one is the most philosophical and thought-provoking In Blue we had a more visually stunning more character-driven plot in White it was more of a light hearted narrative-driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything Red however is focused on the what ifs and how comes It questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the presentbr br This chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner She soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors phone calls through advanced spying equipment All three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines but bring a lot more to the story Consider in Blue the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones We are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary French society and how that reflects the characters behavior Red is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older mans life but it is also about chance hope and fatebr br Irene Jacob stars as Valentine Dussaut who at first finds the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant) whom we never find the name of extremely self-centered and disgusting Though through self reflective analysis and her voyeuristic intentions she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her if only he was 40 years younger Irene lives across from another younger judge who highly resembles the old man This is the what if that keeps circling in the movie What if Irene were born 40 years ago? The old man would have been her perfect match But what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match since he so closely resembles the older one Valentine doesnt know this only we do and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which Irene is in We are constantly smacked in the face with his presence as almost a suggestion of Irenes fatebr br I mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason That reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story We are to compare the old judge to Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit) the younger judge in more than one way We learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away In another scene we see Auguste heartbroken as the love of his life gets away with another man There are constant reminders of whether or not Valentine will ever meet this man Even though they pass each other without noticing every single day There is also the motif of the telephone to Valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life to Auguste it is what leads to his heartbreak and to the old man it is the only thing he has left These three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology It is a sort of statement about what they are and who they arebr br All three Colors films stand for a certain principle most common in France Blue stands for Liberty (the personal being) White stands for Equality (being accepted by more than one) and Red is Fraternity (to socialize to learn) And although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the Fraternity principle Kieslowski makes sure he brings in the other two as well in order to connect all three stories For example we see the old man trying to reach out to Valentine and enlighten her with his spy equipment which is a reflection of the Equality principle We also see near the end that Valentine is doing some soul searching and that shes more concerned about herself than others (not picking up the phone when Michel calls) a clear example of Liberty And with all three principles established Kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well in the final and most heartfelt scenebr br Red is about where you could have been if you were older or younger It is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone and whether or not one person can change your life The final chapter in the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling It is not only about our modern life but about where life could and should be in our modern time And although the movie is more subtle than both Blue and White it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassionbr br Its hard to imagine that Red was Kieslowskis last film and that he died at such a young age Nevertheless the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman Fellini and Wenders as a truly remarkable director whos never been awarded with an Oscar Kieslowski you have been missed!
In the goofs section for this film theres a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where Augustes car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene This is incorrect One of the views is from Augustes flat the other is from Valentinés flat across the street The whole purpose of this segment is to show how Valentiné and Auguste - who may be made for each other - almost cross paths (as happens several other times) but never quite do so until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film (And here there is the implication that Joseph has manipulated things so that Auguste is on that ferry having inspected Valentinés ticket to see which sailing she is booked on)
Its my favourite film because theres so much going on that you dont see at first and so many things that make you wonder Did Kieslowski mean that or is it in my head? For instance - is the judge meant to be God or some supreme being ?br br Also Irene Jacob as in The Double Life Of Veronique is outstanding there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she doesbr br Tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to Valentine    Be
Valentine a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad they plan to meet up in England but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses One night after declining a pass made by her coworker she hits a dog named Rita The dog survives and she returns it to her owner a hostile retired judge whos is living as a hermit and eavesdropper listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours She becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often often becoming part of his eavesdropping games One conversation the two listen in on is of extreme importance though the conversation between a young soon to be judge and his wife which we find out parallels the life of the man who is eavesdropping upon them As we find out more about the couple the man reveals more of his story then continues his story and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate Little does Valentine know how her life this encounter and the fate of the young judge will become entangled together Her hitting the dog that day seemed to be fate a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner allowing Valentine to be the saviour of the young judge who is traveling the same path as her dear friend to prevent him from having such a grim future filled with loneliness and solitude It seems the old mans dream will come true after all and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his daysbr br An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me He is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art Three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome Usually signified with a subtle pause or late focus in a scene see if you can spot some I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with Valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her TV solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years I couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy! I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film movies anythingA Work of Art! 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy
and there are not many in cinema history Rouge seems to be a bit of a hope Hope in mankind and in life But to say only that may be naive Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model Perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated -theres the new couple with the young judge after the accident- But what to say about this master of the camera? You cant miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces Kieslowski loved human beings and that is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors Ms Jacob and Mr Tringtignant are perfect Its not only this movie but the downbeat Thou shall not kill and A story about love that may you think about contemporary cinema as a way of expressing an artists point of view Pity American public -the average one- could not see these films At least they are not in the Maltins dictionary And even the Baseline does not know what to say about this unique man abel posadas
It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowskis trilogy it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: view them in order Blue White and Red and consider them together as one complete work It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty equality fraternity and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry They are each well worth seeing independently but I believe they are best seen as one work Collectively I would rate the trilogy as a 9; separately I place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994br br The color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad the profiled model of which is the central of the movies three main characters The other two characters do a double-take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad posted larger than life alongside a busy city intersection This ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons I have called Red a mind-bending film This is the third of Kieslowskis Three Colors trilogy based on the Blue-White-Red of the French flag and the three parts of its motto Liberty Equality Fraternity The films stay primarily focused on these themes keeping with the basic levels of one two or three main characters yet with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal (Liberty Blue) to relational (Equality White) to social (Fraternity Red) Red is my favorite of these films and I give it a 9 It stands by itself as a great film but one should see Blue and White first for the fullest effect
The final part of Kieslowskis trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image In Red imagery is paramount as well as the obvious but clever color coding However rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the cinema du look Kieslowskis Red is a multi-layered densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love In Red love and fate are intertwined but complex notions dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by You sense Red is really an allegory a reenactment of Prosperos omnipresent gestures in The Tempest yet it is more than its story appears Red demands countless viewings and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structurebr br Although Red stands alone as a masterwork from Kieslowski its best viewed as part of the trilogy Elements of Blue and White are referenced in Red which knowing viewers will enjoy
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s Theres hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being br br Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva where she works as a model Though she has a boyfriend she seems to be rather lonely One night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner a retired jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls Disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again Two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other br br The story itself is too complex to be told completely there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and Valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendshipbr br The actors are wonderful Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship br br The topics are of an endless validity Fraternity not only in contact with each other but also in the respect for the right of privacy Alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994br br Red is one of the strongest colours that exists representing inner turmoil love anger and passion Used here as another protagonist it brings a unmatched depth to the movie A masterpiece!
See Three Colors: Blue and Three Colors: White They are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale Three Colors: Red Red is a fantastic film It can be enjoyed in a single viewing and indeed the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing But watch it again Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie you will see new things with each viewing With the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind With each additional viewing you find yourself discovering that it is in fact a work of genius Red is meant to symbolize fraternity in the French flag The story turns the theme of fraternity around to be viewed at angles one would never suspect The facets of fraternity shared by the different characters is as deep as you care to peer If you are used to the blatant symbolism in most mass films you may find Red a bit slow You may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom and yawning wonder what all the excitement is about This is not a mindless vicarious experience Everything is not explained to you You must think as you watch You must see not simply look Wonderful movie one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful moviegoer
This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema He intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament He died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing Destiny decided that this was indeed his last And what a film!br br Rouge the last film in the three colors French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film Set in Geneva one of the two main characters is a Swiss retired judge and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind But there is more Switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life Several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have stagedbr br Little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times Yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the American style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers They deserve it The film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the Hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters Cinema quality is very original the image being a Study in Red as the title shows Acting is fabulous with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age br br A great film Seeing it again probably adds and I am happy to have it recorded on tape 910 on my personal scale
I feel at a loss so brilliant is this film Kieslowski is a writer a philosopher; and while an excellent filmmaker his greatness lies in his writing; and Red is his paradigm This film is a metafictional study of the artists judgement in the creation of his fictional world; of how an artist can attempt to remake life -- even his own -- thru his art even as he cannot escape the knowledge that no matter how he involves himself in his story it is still fiction and he is still outside of his remade world still burdened with its unreality and the reality of the life he has tried to artistically remake And magically all of this is not to the smallest degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters who live out this story this pre-judged destiny If I had to choose I might nominate this the greatest film ever made
Its almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people in on some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy The more I see them and think of them and imagine myself in their world the more I get its theme: that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion In BLUE Juliette Binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected In WHITE an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will against the odds conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle And now in RED all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young Genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other peoples livesbr br This young girl is appropriately named: Valentine (a luminous Irene Jacob) who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway Not that she is without some baggage: she has a boyfriend unseen who also demands to know what she is doing at all times she has a brother who troubles her and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard She strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health but when she takes her to the owner a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant) he does not want her I want nothing he coldly says and elements of BLUE suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man who also lives in anonymity and apparent free-floating freedom conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people This male version of Juliette Binoches character at first shocks Valentine -- she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror but a chance event has her back at his place and here is when he begins revealing who he is and his great lossbr br At the same time Kieszlowski is unfolding a parallel story: the story of a young man Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit) about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from Valentine -- but they keep missing each other Chance is the word Like Valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits elements of chance pepper her life and Augustes He has a girlfriend who also supplies people with telephoned reports about the weather One of them happens to be the old judge He knows more about her than Auguste does and hes never met her Like God or Prospero he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression We meet again Its this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes RED so beautiful and transcendent because time is in reality a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it There are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames so many things would be differentbr br Such is the case with Valentine and the old judge I believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond: she is that woman whom he did not meet -- by chance or not -- and is whether he knows it or not trying to make amends hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the social outcast But it doesnt end there One of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container Where Julie did not see her (and would not have helped her anyhow) and Karol fresh from his public humiliation sneers at her thinking Someone is worse off than I am Valentine is the one who helps her Frailty in need can happen anywhere and Kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor characterbr br Now RED is so much more than a story Valentine the old judge Auguste even Rita the dog: these arent characters confined by storytelling An American version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbed-down ending RED is so devoid of a linear defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and placebr br Adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal This is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films: in BLUE Julies husband had a mistress and she also betrays Olivier when its become clear shes emotionally dead In WHITE Dominique has Karol listen to her moan over the phone (which becomes an important device in RED) as she has sex with a man while the billboard of Brigite Bardots CONTEMPT looks on In RED the old judges tale of love and betrayal gets re-enacted And all this time Valentines billboard image looms over them like a presage of what is to come at the same time that Rita the dog Valentines car struck bears seven pups life renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously filmed with care and love Why do I say six? Youll have to watch the movie and wonder
Brilliant Aussie movie A little slow at the beginning but once it gets going you cant stop laughing When I originally saw the movie I vaguely knew the plot line as I am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story and more so in particular the director and his mother (obviously names have been changed) I only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family When I saw the movie somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet Matthew Newton after the screening Such a nice gentleman (except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex)! Brillian casting as well with Sam Neill and others! A great reason to keep supporting the Australian film industry
I saw this film purely by chance It was shown very late or more correctly very early one morning on television I had woken up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came onbr br It deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere (it certainly isnt as good as Educating Rita despite a couple of additional twists) and has a very predictable endingbr br Despite its very obvious shortcomings I did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a wholebr br I am a big fan of Sam Neil and have seen him in many different films including: Dead Calm; The Piano; Sirens; Children of the Revolution; Event Horizon; Bicentennial Man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park He was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shutbr br Some of the acting was in my opinion dreadful Rose Byrne for example and some of the elusions were rather heavy handed (all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for example)br br However two actors (who I hadnt or dont remember seen before) impressed me a lot Sinéad Cusackn as Frances (Frank) Kennedy and especially Matthew Newton as her son David He in particular was very convincing and I would like to see a lot more of him
A fantastic film featuring great Aussie talent Director Mark Lamprell dealt with the potentially sob-inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing Definitely the highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival Australian film veteran Sam Neill was as always fabulous in the role of Franks uni professor and new talent Matt Newton gave a performance which will have people saying  you know Bert Newton Matts dad! Get out and see this movie!!!
The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great Aussie films around or that they are all the samebr br Well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other Australian films It is unique - it will make you laugh out-loud it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourselfbr br The casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none The script and the photography (colourlight etc) is wonderful But more important this is a great film I dont want to talk about the plot as I think it is always best to see a film knowing as little about it as possible Suffice to say this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences Take your girlfriend take your Mum take your friends - for a great evening outbr br 1010!!!!
I cant see how a film of this quality only gets an average of 57 from IMDb voters Its a classic Australian production that resembles recent efforts such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES THE SUGAR FACTORY OCCASIONAL COARSE LANGUAGE RUSSIAN DOLL SAMPLE PEOPLE THE SECRET LIFE OF US LA SPAGNOLA STRANGE PLANET FRESH AIR DUST OFF THE WINGS DOING TIME FOR PATSY CLINE etc as a 19-year-old uni student (Newton in perhaps his best role yet on par with CHANGI at least) with a bored over-religious mother gets the shock of his life when she decides to enrol in the same course as him - and before you go thinking ANOTHER GOOFY MOVIE its not theres some real substance here Sure its a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular (but then they are rather simplistic under all that philosophical mumbo-jumbo arent they?) and maybe the study of Sinead Cusacks character is a little muddled at times but the film is bright funny and has some important messages The principle cast is terrific: Cusack and Newton are wonderful and Rose Byrne (see her also in THE GODDESS OF 1967) is so underrated its not funny Shes a beautiful fresh confident actor who deserves every accolade she receives I gave MY MOTHER FRANK 810
My Mother Frank begins as a warm amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank short for Francis played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her sons university Most of her friends and family are horrified not least her son (Matthew Newton) who is busy falling in love with his best mates girlfriend (Rose Byrne) Meanwhile Frank has raised the ire of her disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill)br br Matthew Newton is utterly disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role even when the characters uptight He generates valuable goodwill steering the audience through some of the films more awkward broad comedy moments Not long after the half-way point first-time writer-director Mark Lamprell expertly steers his film into darker emotional territory and gives Cusack a real chance to shinebr br The supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces (Lynette Curran Sacha Horler Nicholas Bishop) and all the principals (including a more animated than usual Sam Neill) are excellent While it meanders a little towards the end My Mother Frank delivers more than it promises and is a genuine Australian crowd-pleaser
The Japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the worldand this is one of the strongest examplesWith a running time at about an hourit contains enough sexual violence and gore to disgust every single sane person on earth(even those who are hunting this type of movies)Three men and a woman are making a porn filmAfter some normally shots(which are pixelated)the girl is tied upand the madmen cut her foodarm and tongAfter thatthey make a hole in her abdomen and a man has sexual intercourse with her intestinesHe is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut offThe special effects are good for an obviously low budget production(only the tong cut scene looks fake)and we cant talk about actingdirection or screenplayAfter hearing a lot about this filmI was very happy when I finally found itThe first part is pretty boringbut the second one totally fk up my mindthe torture and killing scenes being some of the most extreme and disturbing I have ever seenThe gore hounds will be satisfied by Tumbling Doll of Fleshbut an unknowing viewer shouldnt even read the synopsis
Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my want list for quite a while and then I finally scored a copy on Ebay a while back Its never been on DVD and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R which Im quite satisfied with The movie is I believe the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on porn A woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed The porn is definitely real with the annoying Japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots without much success most of the time After the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest This is after both legs have been severed her arm and a few other niceities This movie outdoes the Guinea Pig series by a long shot in fact they are not even close to the realism although cheap gore effects shown in this movie This is indeed one of the best fake snuff films I have ever seen if not the best Now I must warn you that if you are not into this stuff you should stay far far away This movie is very strong and with the real sex it is in a very sick way erotic to an extent And I mean in a very sick way But wherever you come down on this subject material this movie brings the goods home and I would definitely recommend you seek it out After reading about the movie I was expecting something very strong but it exceeded that by a bunch
First of all  you should watch this only if you dont mind the lack of subtitles  pornography  kinky sex and utter  horrifying and truly shocking depravity  I mentioned kinky sex  but to call sex in the second half of the movie  kinky  would be a great understatement  Its more like a punch in the face if you arent prepared for this sort of sickness  That being said  I can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo - snuff genre brought to us by our fellow Japanese br br The plot seems to be fairly basic  almost nonexistent : a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie  Dont expect much in first 30 - 40 minutes  There is some dialog - if you dont speak Japanese its not going to mean much to you - that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew & performer  then there is some porn ( straight sex )  and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break  And then  it starts to happen br br It seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene - this time tied with the rope  The abuse begins : whipping  slapping  hot wax  In the end  girl breaks down and cries  They untie her br br Then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened - except for the girl  She is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave  She walks to the door  sits on the floor to put her shoes on  and thats when hell breaks loose br br She is hit in the head with the baseball bat  her wound is treated  she is tied to the bed  What ensues can be briefly described ( Im not going to spoil everything for you ) as rape during dismemberment  Think of  Flower of flesh and blood   mix it with porn and you will get the idea It goes on for about 20 minutes or so  SFX are very good  makeup too  Everything is shown  with no mercy for the viewer  You have been warned br br I thought  Visitor Q  was a very sick movie  After watching  Niku daruma  it looked like a fairytale to me This movie is so sick  so depraved  so twisted  so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to its finale  Too bad its released only on VHS so there are no subtitles available  But the movie still works without them  So  if you are into ultra sickness  extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre  check this out  I hope you wont have nightmares 810 
If you were enjoyed by watching Guinea Pig - then youll like this movie to! Psycho: The Snuff Reels is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements Actually the effects are not so realistic like in Guinea Pig but its still pretty gorybr br Psycho: The Snuff Reels contains 70 minutes of sex fetish and then torture scenes First 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie After that youll see fetish sex scenes And last one is a torture scene The guys torture and rape girl - they cut off her legs hand tongue In the end guy rapes girl in her stomach (!) and after that other guy beat him and cut off his balls Sounds pretty sick isnt it?:) br br Like I said - its pseudo snuff movie Psycho: The Snuff Reels is pretty rare Japanese movie and as I know its really hard to find it But if you are crazy about that sort of films I believe that you can find it!
Tumbling Doll of Flesh by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abusetorture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actionsTypically twisted Japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly goreThere is no plot to speak ofjust plenty of hard core sex scenes(optically censored again)and lots of bloodThe special effects are quite impressive-the dismemberment of Japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detailThe tongue cutting scene really made me squirmHer arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestinesPsycho:The Snuff Reels actually reminds me Guinea Pig:Flowers of Flesh and Bloodbut its not as memorableSo if youre a fan of ultra-depraved Japanese sickies like All Women Are Whores or Raping My Virgin Slave give this one a look8 out of 10
The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to Cricket) in India The use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish as it signifies one who is sharp fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong waybr br Ghilli is one of the best movies for Vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action The movie never slacks for a moment and keep you always with some exciting action The movie is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story core is simple A rich landlord tries to covet a beautiful girl in his town and his unquestionable power and authority prevents the girl from seeking a justice The hero tries to rescue her and the majority of this movie portrays the week in which all this action happensbr br A very exciting movie and though the story is nothing new the director and the actors receive praise for the full-paced action
if u havent seen Vijay in Ghillli Gilly or Ghillie go watch it wow its devastatingly hilarious i dont know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not There are tons of hot guys in this one look out for someone who calls Velu Maacha The one with the brilliant braids devastatingly hot His teeth are brilliant as well Vijay rocks Trisha cries every 5 seconds It is very deep Watch it you wont regret it There are some great laughs in this one If you dont speak Tamil learn it Then you will get all the inside jokes It is one for the whole family except maybe the violent bits should be skipped Ive seen this movie around eleven times  and countingbr br Wow!
Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career As I had not seen the Telegu movie so I could enjoy this movie even moreThe story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine Vijay who had come to play a Kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her The rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goons fathers political cronies The movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end Vijay is as usual very good in role of the kabaddi player TrishaAshish Vidyarthithe bunch of vijay friends all have done their job competently A special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie PrakashrajThe villains character has been properly etched out and prakashraj has portrayed it very well Surprisingly for the first time I felt sympathy for the villain in the end The dialogue Hi Chellam has really caught on with the masses The music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song apadi podu is a rage all overDharani has to be credited with such a nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by the general tamil movie audience all over the world
brilliant screenplaybr br the screenplay is very tight that u will be gelled in seatbr br this movie is an example for movie can survive only with screenplay and no-story neededbr br story is very simple that u can write in one line but screenplay was amazingbr br brilliant performance by Vijay and Prakashrajbr br though plot is similar to okkadu director adapted only the plot Tamil version is much fast paced than Telugubr br Movie travels straight without any chance of deviation though u can understand each and every characters back-dropbr br keep going
Ghillie a remake of the Telugu okkadu is thankfully a clarified version of the original It packs the same punch and Dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache A flagging Vijays career with the entry of the likes of Surya and Vikram on the fray got the much needed uplift with this movie This might well prove to be the best movie Vijay has ever been on considering the choices he has been making since then The hard-working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alikebr br The tightly snug script which runs at a neck-break speed revolves around Velu a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of Kabaddi( a popular game among boys in India) The events following the chance encounter with Muthupandi his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie Vijay fits as a T into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next doorbr br Trisha has more than a stereotyped Tamil heroine mantle to play The role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble With limited dialogs Trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role This is a classic case of a cover page girl coming-of-age to become a professional actress Trisha became my personal favorite after this moviebr br The movie ends on predictable lines although one has to credit the Director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including Trishas change in decision to leave the country Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter-weight for Vijays role His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the heros armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessingbr br Overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing I give it a clear 8 out of 10
Am an ardent Vijay fan I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as thisbr br It has all the regular clichés that one can expect from a commercial entertainer A hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte ieKabbadi His friends to fill in the comedy quota A heroine in a life-and-death situation A villain which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist High octane chase and action sequences Music that can make one dance And above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle Perfectbr br The director doesnt give any chance for the audience to loosen up He just goes on from one nail on the head to the next And one can see the lighter side of Vijay in this film which he rarely executesbr br All saidThis movie was and will be perfect for many years to come
If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli Okkadu you will find this to be very similar in story line but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andra pradesh Although this is a remake of Okkadu you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film Vijay and Trisha make a great pair A few negatives were when Vijays character slaps Trishas character for going to buy a present for him he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end Good action and songs make this an all around great movie I recommend itbr br I give it a 1010 one of the best I have seen
I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie Of course as Im sure you know that Malcolms in the Middle star Frankie Muniz and the ever so sweet Amanda Bynes The Amanda Show starred in this childrens comedy as two friends that Im sure that we can all re-late to The movie is about a boy Jason Shepard(Frankie) and his friend Kaylee(Amanda)going onto an adventure in Hollywoodbr br SPOILERS AHEADbr br As it begins Jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day lifes problems One day Jason is hit by Mr Wolf(the big bad director) Jasons english paper is stolen by Wolf and begins the adventure along with kaylee to earn his fathers trust back They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to get him back Frankie and Amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get Wolf back and all he has to do is call Jasons dad and tell him he stole his idea But the end is no real surprise being the good proveles and winsbr br The story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect its rated PG I really belive this is one of the years best family comedies Not only is the childrens acting great exceptional casting well written but its good clean fun It made me laugh as well as fall in love with its innocent message I highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten The unemployed critic isnt unemployed for nothing I give it (well i voted a ten out of ten) a perfect
Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever! It is funny and cool Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves that he was not lying and goes to Los Angeles to Get his paper back from Marty Wolf( Paul Giamatti) Along with friend Kaylee(Amanda Bynes) mess up his life since Marty wont call Jasons dad and say he wrote the paper! Yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch!
Well it might be a kids movieperhaps but im not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it!so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm?!it is teenager movie i agreeso but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very goodso good that at the end nobody nows truth or lieAnyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit itthe truth is never overated
I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; Its not like American Pie or something I know not why people are offended by the Universal plugs; since its part of the plot the advertising is excusablebr br This is a funny movie with good dialogue good subtle wit a good story a good moral (that thankfully doesnt get too sappy) GREAT acting and a cheesy endingbr br (minor spoiler) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes along So he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they go and drive the Wolf crazybr br Frankie Muniz can be annoying in other roles but not as Jason Shepherd He handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantnessbr br Amanda Bynes What more can I say? The girls got the gift Shes funny talented versatile and very very attractive (Im only 6 months older than her I need to get to California sometime soon) In fact the best-friend part was originally a boy but became a girl as soon as the makers saw Amandas interest Which works out pretty well since the part wouldve been pretty dull without the blessing of Byness abilitiesbr br Paul Giamatti is a very talented man While some would play Marty Wolf as evil and diabolical Giamatti made him-not just a jerk mind you but a LIKEABLE jerk a jerk that livens up the screen rather than intentionally dimming it And I doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that Wolf undergoes as wellbr br All in all great movie Loved seeing Jaleel White able to mock himself Loved seeing all the little references & such built into the film (one of the guests in the party scene is the director Shawn Levy another is Byness former co-star Kenan Thompson) Loved seeing Amanda in those outfits Get the DVD if you can Its got all kinds of great extra stuff and the lovely Ms Bynes is your guide through the menus :)
Who said it had to be believable? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film Youll enjoy the experience much more Youll find yourself forgiving some of the movies more outlandish plot set-ups and simply accepting it for what it is--a great family film I appreciated not having to be concerned about questionable elements in a childrens film for once That to me is worth the price of the ticket And it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it--older chidlren will enjoy this film Enough good humor to keep adults interested Very good film
Fun movie! Great for the kids - they found it very entertaining Somewhat predictable but there are a few surprises Great movie to watch if youre looking for something just to entertain (dont expect to be seeing a classic!)
With all of the R movies out today its hard to find something you can take the whole family to see My kids loved it It was good clean fun I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family out for a nice evening at the movies
I wasnt expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script who then he travels to hollywood to get even but hey its still a fun film Frankie Muniz of Malcom in the Middle fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and Amanda Bynes as his friend is also very good Yea the film does work as an advertisement for Universal Studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film but i enjoyed it anyways GRADE: B-
SPOILER ALERT!!!! This was my sons review of the movie which he wanted me to postHe wrote this I swearbr br With Malcolm in the Middles Frankie Muniz and Nickelodeons Amanda Bynes they get to go to show business They team up on the actor Paul Giamatti He stole Jason Shepherds essay on Big Fat Liar and makes it in to a movie Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to LA to get it back Jasons dad does not believe that he wrote that essay So every time they see each other Jason asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to give Jasons dad a call because he wants his essay BACK!!!! Wolf does not make the movie but the President of the company makes it At the end the family and Kaylee see the movie Made by Wolf Pictures and based on a real story written by Jason Shepherd
After seeing Big Fat Liar I think Jason learned a lot more When he told the truth about Marty stealing his story it was like the boy who cried wolf People heard him but they didnt believe him Nobody did anything to help him Besides not only Martys movies stink so does his advice The truth is not overrated I am so glad he got exposed for what he really is Everyone found out that he stole from that boy including his parents Not only he stole from that boy and lied about it he gave them someone elses work and tried to call it his own which is plagiarism Doesnt he know that it is illegal to plagiarize someones idea? Another reason why he got fired He is not trustworthy Hes a liar a cheat a thief a crook and a plagiarist You got that Marty? Youre a plagiarist Plus you got everything that you deserved
Big fat liar is a pretty funny movie But as I was watching it I thought about something Some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable So really the film is kind of a big fat lie There is no way that he couldve gotten away with all of this Here are all of the unbelievable stuffbr br 1 When he fakes his father had choked on a meatball and acts like he is the father Jason(Frankie Munez) couldnt have gotten away with that Well luckily for us he didnt So it didnt stick with it the outrageousbr br 2Even if the Grandmother was blind she still couldve figured out that that wasnt her granddaughter br br 3They couldnt have gotten on the plane flown to LA acted like they were coat salesmen sneak into the studio and then and then Well some of the film is a little unbelievable But it doesnt hurt to tell a little white lie Trust me I do it all the timebr br Big fat liar though unbelievable at times is fun Its also very funny But let me just say one thing before I continue this review If Paul Giamatti wasnt in this movie it would really suck It would be horrible Big fat liar is also pretty funny though corny at times I give it a thumbs upbr br Big fat liar:
Big Fat Liar is a great watch for kids of all ages even adults I had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under The laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too! Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is hilarious! Overall a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time
BIG FAT LIAR in my opinion is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it When Jason (Frankie Muniz - MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - ALL THAT) played those tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE) I really smiled and felt good Thats what I liked most about this movie As a matter of fact everything that happened after Jasons essay erroneously ended up in Martys hands was hilarious I especially loved Jaleel Whites cameo When I first saw him I couldnt be certain but when I asked my mother if it was him she said Of course! Before I wrap this up Id like to say Like I said earlier there is a moral to this story and that moral is always tell the truth Now in conclusion if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz Amanda Bynes or Paul Giamatti I highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it
SPOILER WARNINGbr br Weve all heard the Boy Who Cried Wolf legend But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world Well it might be something like Big Fat Liar Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd ( Frankie Muniz from Malcolm in the Middle ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble One day he is pressured to write an English essay but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) who plans to turn Jasons story into a Hollywood blockbuster No one believes Jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school However Jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to LA with his friend Kaylee ( Amanda Bynes ) When Wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story Jason plans to make Wolfs life a living hell BFL is no masterpiece but its a nice way to spend 90 minutes of youre time I wished they couldve made it a bit longer though and there arent that much pranks although they are clever enough ( I like the pool-dye the best ) I might not have liked this as much as I do if it werent for Paul Giamatti He is simply hilarious in this If you have 90 minutes to kill try this out You might just enjoy it
I love this movie br br Yes the main character lies but thats why its called big fat liar Even though this kid runs away to Hollywood it doesnt give kids the idea that they can Besides he doesnt just do it for fun or to get away from anything he does it to regain trust br br I dont think it was just one big ad for Universal Studios because I liked how it gave an inside view of what its like for kids who dont know how cool movie-making is br br It has good music and fun characters This familycomedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike It has humour excitement and real life difficulties like lyingbr br In the end Big Fat Liar sends out a moral: dont expect lying to be easy
This isnt a life-changing movie; its not an epic or anything like that But its entertaining and its fun Its a film that the whole family can watch together and at the moment there are precious few kid-suitable films that DONT have a love story in them! It tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to dazzle the audience with over-the-top special effects like lots of films these days are Its got some fairly good acting in and all the music thats been used fits in pretty well with the movie content The acting is quite good too the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny Id recommend it for people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh :)
This is one of the funniest movies Ive ever saw A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper called Big Fat Liar When his skateboard was taken he had to use his sisters bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo When he went into the limo he met a famous producer from Hollywood Marty Wolf When he left the limo he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jasons English paper into a movie! When Jason admitted that he left his paper in the limo and Marty took it his parents and his English teacher didnt believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to make Marty admit he stole his story to Jasons parents When Jason told Marty to call his dad that Marty stole that paper Marty tricked him and burned his paper! Jason got so angry that Marty burned that paper so Marty called security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kaylee realized Marty isnt going to admit the truth In order to take Marty down in Phase 2: The Takedown Jason and Kaylee put permanent blue dye into the pool and when Marty jumps in his body turns all blue and it wouldnt come off! Then they put permanent orange dye in Martys shampoo and when he uses it his hair turns all orange and it wouldnt come off too! Finally they put lots of glue on Martys earpiece to make him call Jasons father and when Marty uses it it sticks to his ear! It was funny when Martys hair and body turns all blue and orange and his headset is glued to his ear! After that they tricked Marty by telling Monty who is Martys assistant that Duncan moved to a house where theres a party going on When Marty went in to see Duncan he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! When Marty was in the house Jason and Kaylee switched the controls of his car When Marty drove his car he knew all the controls were switched and he didnt know which button to push Hes stupid enough to fall for it When Marty hit the rear end of the masher the masher wrecked his car! It was so funny So Marty starts to call Jasons dad and tricked him again! He was on the phone but it wasnt his father he called security! After the security got Jason and Kaylee out of Martys site they suggested them to go home Monty was going to be on Jason and Kaylees side cause she knew that Marty was a liar and a jerk so she told Rocco who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids Jason told his father the truth of what hes been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to LA When Monty came to the kids shes going to help the kids move into Phase 4: The Payback Jason splits the crew into 3 teams for Phase 4 One team will distract and trick Marty until Jasons parents get to the set Marty first rode with Frank Jackson but his car broke down so he rode with Jaleel but he took him into the desert and leave him there When Marty was in the desert a helicopter came to rescue him After that one of the blades are jammed so Marty and the pilot got off the helicopter After that he was on the way to the set and when Jason saw him Marty stopped and saw what Jason has: his monkey! So Marty went after Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester he released the water and when the water came it pushed Marty away Marty was still after the kids and when Kaylee went the other way Jason led Marty to the top of the apartment building At the top Jason was challenging Marty by making him admit the truth and Marty will never ever tell the truth When the crew caught Marty in surprise all the people including Jasons parents who were at the set knew what Marty did Marty was going to kill Jason but the only way for Jason to escape is jump down from the top! After that his parents believed him that Marty took his story When the people who were on the set left this is the end of Marty At the end Jasons story Big Fat Liar was a movie I cant get enough of it
I could watch this movie ALL DAY! I LOVE it Probably my all time favorite movies But by the way badger1970 there are a few parts with bad language not TOO bad but its not exactly G rated GREAT movie!!!!! I recommend it to everybody Any way its making me type 10 lines of text so I am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment Okay Still typing This is getting annoying Ugh I still have four more to go Anyway WATCH THIS MOVIE! Even if you have already seen it I DONT CARE! Has it been 10 lines yet? Nope Only 2 more lines left I dont even know why it wants me to do this I think I am done Wait a minute Im NOT done SORRY people I know its torture listening to me WEll I suppose that you dont HAVE to read this comment But you should because I wrote it I am probably done now Finally bye
Much better than expected Good family flick - catch it on reruns The whole is more than the sum of its parts Paul Giamatti chews up the scenery - he has way more talent then the role deserves A treat to watch Inspector Uhl from The Illusionist go over the top The blue man scenes had my 11 year old in stitches The cameos were particular fun for the parents - nice to see Lee Majors and Urkel (umm Jaleel) again Its going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film  but lets hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents! Amanda Bynes does a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting I normally cant stand Frankie Muniz but he is just fine here Hats off to the casting director - if only for hiring Giamatti!
I cant understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5210? It really is great very funny I would strongly recommend this movie for all of you adults teenagers and especially children! br br The story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie at home and school One day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story But he didnt so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours or he would have to go to Summer School Yep he wrote it in 2:45 Big fat liar I think it was a story of himself On the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous Hollywood producer and he gave him a ride But the kid forgot the story in the limo He told his parents and the teacher but of course they did not believe him And the movie producer he took the kids story as his new movie Big fat liar When the kid saw the trailer of the movie he told his parents he had written it but they didnt believe So he and his friend had to go to LA to prove one thing: The truth is never overrated br br Enjoy this great movie you wont be disappointed Dont trust the 5210 rate it should be 910! Believe me! br br PS: so sorry my English isnt good enough to make a better comment!
I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot He would probably say it was easy but he really does a great job and should have won something for it Weve had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy now 4 12 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over and the humor is adult enough that I dont mind having to hear it in the background (and I do run to the TV for the really funny parts) Simple moral message lots of decent action and slapstick bad grownups acting goofy to take the edge off minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard
This movie was fun! Especially if your between 8 and 15 Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it Paul Giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to get My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it Parents: No really bad words or any sex to worry about Recommend it for the right crowd AP
Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing great production and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap The two stars work great together and--what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines Putting Irkel and Lee Majors in the film were brilliant touches Watch this film with your kids If you dont laugh throughout it you must not have been paying attention
I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 x 10 So I really wasnt going to watch it But I like Malcolm in the Middle so I thought Id watch just a few minutes Next thing I know Im sucked in having a great time and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by I agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment Being one of the older baby boomers I was also pleased to see Lee Majors with a role in the movie as with a couple of other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) yesterday but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselvesbr br Its your basic kid is wronged kid gets even (and then some) and everyone enjoys themselves in the process No heavy thinking no great analysis needed Just a good fun way to pass the timebr br 35 out of 5
Big Fat Liar comes as a welcome -- shallow but welcome -- breath of fresh air after one too many films featuring bathrooms bodily fluids pets on acid gaseous jokes and crotch gags After all See Spot Run Max Keebles Big Move and Snow Dogs had signaled The Degenerative Spiral of Kiddie Movie-making Worse is the realization that the young audience would later be satiated by the smuttier offerings of Not Another Teen Movie and Slackers Written by Nickelodeon producers Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who coincidentally co-starred on the 80s sitcom Head of the Class) the film stars Frankie Muniz as Jason whos always ready with a good lie to get out of scrapes (Wheres the English paper? Dad choked on a Swedish meatball) His teacher (Sandra Oh) issues an ultimatum: Turn in the paper by the end of the day or take summer school Jason whips out a story called Big Fat Liar and is struck en route to school by a limousine carrying insensitive Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) Wolf gives him a ride but Jason leaves his paper behind No one will hear the truth this time and Dad tells him hes lost his trustbr br Months later Jason and best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) see a movie preview for Big Fat Liar and head off to Los Angeles to wreak havoc on Wolfs life -- all to get a confession that he stole Jasons paper to make the film They even gain the sympathy of some of Wolfs abused employees including his assistant (Amanda Detmer) former chauffeur (Donald Faison) movie star (Jaleel Urkel White playing himself) and stunt coordinator (a much-aged Lee Majors)br br Because Big Fat Liar is without the edge that his sitcom Malcolm in the Middle is known for Muniz is easy to root for but doesnt have much to work with Likewise for Bynes who headlines her own Tracey Ullman-like sketch show on Nickelodeon All the hamminess is given to Giamatti whose eyes bulge and cheeks wiggle with every sneering insultbr br The film gets snaps just by attempting the high road and should be enjoyed by its target audience (especially since most of the high jinks occur on the Universal Studios lot) But heres one head-scratcher: The message is that it pays to tell the truth But didnt we just see Jason getting to his payback by telling white lies throughout the film? Well at least theres no poop
This Movie is really an entertaining good clean fun movie for the kiddies Kaley(played by Nickelodeons talented Amanda) is the sidekick to a rambunctious boy who has a hard time telling the truth He eventually works this into a movie script that gets stolen I wont bore you with the details If you have children and want to see an entertaining if not thrilling kids movie I highly recommend this one
Okay Ill admit that if I didnt have kids I never would have seen this film and would never see it But considering all the rotten kids movies I have seen (such as SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY) this is a significant improvement And it had enough in it that I wasnt totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide (something I did repeatedly in the other two movies) Sure the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly--but it IS a kids film And compared with other films in the genre this is definitely better than average Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty--at least on infomercials or doing voice-oversbr br So if you are looking for a film to see with your kids you certainly could do a lot worse!
It is a nice comedy It has the great features of the childhood lying or trying to get away from own generated troubles The casting is great great acting And the special effects ? Well some stunts are really impressive Watch it! :)
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing All the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme I have not readseen the original and as a rule I cant stand Shakespeare but I enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well) Dont expect to see an epic however you should find it moving enough to enjoy By the way (on a side note) dont compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work Movies arent supposed to transfer a book to the screen but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it When people say the book was so much better (theyre usually wrong anyway) what they are really trying to say is the book was so different
Never having read or seen the Bards original work I cant begin to compare this work to his story So I wont Instead I will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in budget but still decent enough to enjoy) I thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing The style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing but I thought it was well done
but its still an entertaining TV movie The transposition to the Civil War makes a nice change of pace and adds a few subtexts (such as Ariels servitude to ProsperProspero) that you might not otherwise see Thankfully they didnt try to make it a mini-series: at 90 minutes its just about right
This is a masterful piece of film-making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more A mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it) But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close-up camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold Its as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work A very rare type of film these days - it holds the attention and stirs the emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative superficial shortcuts
Cant grade this very well because I cant say I liked it But it is the story that bothered me not the realization of the film The acting directing atmosphere music were all good Its just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you cant truly relate to the movie ends It is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings dont need to make any sense at all and still be strong but thats about itbr br The plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend He is married brings his wife and later the kid while the ex (Knightley) marries some other guy But the tension is there Dylan is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of PTSD Add in some pretty temperamental characters and you have your hands fullbr br Bottom line: you have to be in the mood to like this film The hard part is defining this mood I dont think Ive ever been in it yet Ever So it is probably better watched by adults with a grasp on weird complex human behaviour and maybe a curiosity about Dylan Thomas
Although I am very familiar with poet Dylan Thomas I know nothing of his life Whatever his life and specifically his marriage involved I would imagine that The Edge of Love (based on the novel) manipulates things a bit but unless you are a historian or a poet who caresbr br The movie is less about Thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life One is his wife Kathrine and the other is Vera who was his first love One romantic night on the beach as youths is something that both have tried to put behind them but cannot now grown up they are good friends I forgot to mention that this is set during the war Vera becomes engaged to Captain Will Killing who he gets her pregnant and leaves for war While he is away Vera starts to fall for Thomas again and Kathrine has fallen out of love with him She is also carrying another mans child Things get even more emotionally complex when Capt Killig returnsbr br As you can see it is a very soap operatic plot and it takes shape in a fairy drab slow manner with perhaps one too many sequences of sappy dialogue But all is not lost yet For a non- Hollywood production I think that the Edge of Love is about as stylish a picture as one can get It is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romances Hollywood production or not Some of it has to do with being set during the war which sets up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial a bit like Atonement this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent to Joe Wrights Oscar nominee but it is in far greater need for stable pacing and progression Things are okay at the start and finish but the middle section is where your attention span may be tested unless you are deeply and profoundly rooted in the story br br I doubt if The Edge of Love will have that kind of an effect on the viewer but is a good film to check it might even make a good date night movie considering it is so much smarter than the chick flicks that boyfriends are forced to endure today
Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject On the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible a drunkard a bad father a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward Of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still I do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits Any way I found the other male hero of the story Captain Cillic a more endearing character The two female roles were played by actresses Knigtley and Miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire bombarded Londoners during WW2 Another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive milieus that think that age-old conventions can easily be surpassedThe atmosphere of the Blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct outlooks among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorizing on its possible political outcomesI think one would recommend such a movie
This is primarily about love in WWII yet we must remember that its also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his lifebr br The movies timing is just great It really captures what I think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping youre not going to get bombed While it may prove boring to some the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to itbr br At one point my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax It really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors Cillian Murphy is on fine form here as is Matthew Rhys Both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch The relationship formed between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightleys characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank (and watch out for a cameo by Suggs of Madness) br br Despite all of this its a rather slow movie Coupled with the fact its just shy of two hours its quite a slog to get to the conclusionbr br Overall its a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well-known British names behind the scenes But it really does drone on for too much at times Still a worthwhile watch 710
i did not expect to enjoy this in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasnt credited knowing Dylan thomas and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man i didnt feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare and this was not it critical and yet appreciative it was it made me cry kiera knightley was superb even with that slightly strained welsh accentand it is a sad tale that they tell Dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called feisty woman of the pr spiel it is cillian the william of the movie a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly Dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less and well that is how it was marketed it is not a film about Dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it
This film flopped miserably in the UK and it didnt deserve to The trailer of this film is slightly misleading and I guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was Atonement: Part 2 While the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of Joe Wrights BAFTA-winning film its very different in tone It focuses on an imagination of sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas life during the Second World War as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to Wales Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylans (Matthew Ryhs) childhood sweetheart Vera Phillips played by Keira Knightley She was Dylans first love in their homeland but the moment has passed and singer Vera only wants it as a beautiful memory Or does she? Vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in Dylans life Queen of Ireland love of my life mother of my child Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller) The three form a sort of menage a trois in war-struck London but Vera then falls for a dashing soldier William Killick (Cillian Murphy) They quickly marry with Killick leaving for War A frightened Vera convinces the Thomas to return witb her to Wales but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of Veras child Williams jealousy and shell-shock after returning home and Caitlin realising she cannot share Dylan with her best friendbr br Filmed on a low budget this is more of a mood piece than anything else It works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed The performance of Sienna Miller is particularly excrellent (unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense detracts from the fact thats shes quite a talent) and Knightley and Murphy are once again very good The let-down is Rhys as Dylan who while the Welsh poet himself was no bed of roses lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in Dylan The writing is very choppy some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness Its certainly worth watching however
Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of Dylan Thomas Knightley is Thomass boyhood sweetheart he re-encounters during the Blitz Meeting at a bar they reconnect however things become complicated when Thomas brings his wife (Miller) along the next time he meets her The women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become Knightlys husband This further complicates things as jealousy begins to show its facebr br Beautiful to look at extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted (everyone disappears completely into their roles) this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and the ears Its so nice to see a film about adults being adults On a purely visceral level I really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing Rarely have I ever seen a film that is this beautifully craftedbr br The trouble with the film is Im not entirely sure of everything that happened Something seemed to be missing and a couple of times I had to replay the film to see if I missed something Its not bad but its not completely satisfying as a result (I tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but I couldnt find anything) Still I think this is a film worth seeing Its a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done
Welsh poet Dylan Thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in Whitehallbr br Thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance Thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end resting somewhat uncomfortably on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran who had shot up his house and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair withbr br The real story of this film is the love of two women one (Keira Knightley) whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys) the second (Sienna Miller) who is Thomass wife At times it reminds of The Singing Detective as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity
Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally straitlaced as Michael Redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of WB Yeats Writers lives are an endless source of inspirationbr br But of all poets it was Dylan Thomas the roistering free-loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in New York at the age of 39) who was closest in spirit to the film industry During World War II he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries He even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters in which three old maids in a Welsh village plot the murder of their rich half-brother All that is now forgivenbr br In John Mayburys The Edge of Love Thomas is played by the Welsh actor Matthew Rhys Its not a full-scale biopic The film covers four years in the poets life during World War II when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and a former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley) whom he met again by chance during the war It seems he loved them both The relationship of these extraordinary women -- to Thomas and to each other -- is at the heart of Mayburys absorbing filmbr br How it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves Rebekah Gilbertson the films producer is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick William a war hero (played in the film by Cillian Murphy) married Vera while she was still in love with the poet Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents Dylan Thomas: A Farm Two Mansions and Bungalow by David Thomas describing their tangled lives Sharman Macdonald who wrote the screenplay is the mother of Knightley The part requires Knightley to sing and her mother included songs especially for her Surely no film with such felicitous family connections deserves to do other than succeedbr br We begin in London during the Blitz Bombs are falling sirens are wailing and Phillips is singing to sheltering crowds in an underground Tube station In a pub by chance she meets Thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and child Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship untroubled by jealousy or rancour and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs listening to Thomas read his poems exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads off as everyone did in wartime Caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world (My first was Augustus John he seduced me when I was 15) But its the refined and soulful Phillips who stirs Thomass deepest responses and eventually succumbs to his charms In the meantime she has reluctantly married Killick who has seen her in the Tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty (if not her singing)br br It is an intense and strangely beautiful film though Thomas himself may be its least impressive character He is best remembered for Under Milk Wood his verse radio play about a day in the life of the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub whose name spelt backwards was not something polite English teachers drew attention to I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton reading the poem (he appeared in a film of Under Milk Wood in 1971) and Ive never forgotten the creamy seductive quality of his voice The legendary charisma the magnetism of the man is something I missed in Rhyss performance Thomas comes across as a strangely pallid even secondary figure compared with the women in his lifebr br In his previous film Love Is the Devil Maybury explored the turbulent life of painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model George Dyer The Edge of Love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film If you ask what insights it offers into the springs of Thomass creative inspiration I would have to say Llareggub But as an insight into his egotism his smouldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others it is wonderfully sad and revealingbr br Thomas had a good war boozing and writing while other men (including Killick) were being traumatised by the horrors of battle In one scene near the end Thomass behaviour towards his friends seems unforgivably callous But this is not after all Thomass film Murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional debilitation of war Miller is charming and pathetic as the wife And Knightley looks almost too exquisitely delicate to be real (as she did in Pride and Prejudice) But this is probably her finest performance And in every respect the film is worthy of her
With its ww2 timing falling in and out of love and easy on the eye Kira this is re-Atonement br br This a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of WW2 Poet Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales br br Veras ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share An easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace Would work well with French subtitles but then I may have been to too many art house movies lately
From the start of The Edge Of Love the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity Except one of the characters is named Dylan Thomas perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish but at times truly despicable br br This movie is based on Thomas writings about love and romance These were adapted with a sharp screenplay by Sharman MacDonald (Keira Knightleys mother) The director John Maybury does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people br br All four are performed very strongly Sienna Miller is Dylans wife Keira Knightley is the cabaret singer Vera Phillips Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas and Cillian Murphy is William Killick The first section of the movie takes place in London during the Nazi air raids with Vera being pursued by Willaim a soldier waiting for deployment By a chance encounter Dylan meets with his first love Vera From there Vera meets Caitlin Dylans wife While the three are drinking William successfully breaks Veras guard br br The film follows their lives as Vera and William are married and he is sent to war Vera has become pregnant and returns to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin There they face a gritty existence with Vera supporting Dylan and Caitlin with her husbands war pay Through these times Veras and Caitlins friendship grows So does Dylans infatuation with Vera She gives in This creates the first test for the two women br br When William returns from war he barely recognizes his wife and has no bond with his infant son Things get worse as Dylan idly watches his friend struggle with battleground fatigue (post traumatic stress disorder) William realizes something has happened between Dylan and Vera and in a drunken rage shoots up Dylans housebr br Edge Of Love starts as a stylish romance in war torn London and ends in the stark gritty life of motherhood infidelity and attempted murder in Wales The treatment of PTSD is well done and should speak to an American audience Some day (see ending)br br Each star has a great moment Miller when she is yanking out stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another mans child Knightley and Murpy when he finally bonds with his son Oh hell almost all their scenes are awesome And Rhys when he purgers himself on the stand to get Veras husband sent to jail br br Yet the real star of the movie is Jonathan Freemans cinematography and John Mayburys direction They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical Thomas is this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time And they cherish their scenes with stunning shots While this isnt best picture material it is a very good movie (much more engaging than The Dutchess) It has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of Thomas poetry Also this is clearly Knightleys second best performance of her career and perhaps Millers best br br I have always had a weakness for the Artist in struggle whether its Hulces Mozart or Hoffmans Capote But I was stunned at how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas His struggles with alcohol are well known But his antagonism of William and Caitlin to gain possession of his first love Vera makes him out to bea bad manbr br So is this Academy Award Worthy? Clearly no At least not this year It will be released state side in March 2009 making it ineligible for the Academies This is 9 months after it was released in Britain Between Atonement Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited the US has had its fill of WW2 British period pieces Too bad This film is better then the other ones except Atonement But in this one Knightleys soldier does come back but as a shell of the man who left her

Despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war this film isnt too sticky and pink because love is as a rose: With thorns that is The four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down-to-earth br br The music and lyrics of the cabaretchanson-esquire songs (sung b Keira Knightley herself) drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film from one place to another between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love Some people may find it too much a biopic but it ís mostly a romantic story even though it consequently follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy br br London gets visualized from another angle for once the bohemian life of Dylan during the bombings of the Germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms pubs and bars The independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger br br Maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story

We are not told immediately Pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present daybr br Constant echoes of Dylans poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites It reminds me of Marlon Brando reading TS Eliot in Apocalypse Now A light beyond the horrors of the world A different way of seeing things Ill take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no-one died  ever says Dylan to Vera as they walk along the beach Elsewhere Caitlin recalls childhood with Vera: Were still innocent in Dylan she saysbr br Theres a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette (Not literally perhaps) A time to be inspired Enjoy what is possibly the best British film of the year
In this TV special Jon is the one who needs a life The highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer Not content with this forever Jon takes Garfield to a self help group in order to meet people How many people will be interested in a loner 20-something whos best friend is a cat?br br After several failed attempts at getting a girl including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals David Brents fusion of Flashdance and MC Hammer in The Office (Discos dead? says Jon) he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself br br Naturally they get on but Garfield is worried that John will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat Fortunately Jons new girlfriend is allergic to cats br br With slicker animation than past TV specials this feels like a longer episode of Garfield and Friends

I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart and I just knew that I had to see this movie even though I cant say Im a soccer fan But watching this just filled my heart with joy and I had a great time in the movies watching itbr br Bjørn Fast Nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting they grow with the movie and makes it what it is Even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie there is surprisingly little soccer in it The whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word N O R W A Y on their trip to the World Cup in soccer playing in Germany this year br br If youre only gonna see one Norwegian movie this year this is the one
This was one of the few Norwegian movies I actually looked forward too see It started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches Then they made a movie out of it The leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me awaybr br Norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but I had a good feeling about this one Even thou Im not interested in football I wanted 2 see it the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up there are loads of cameos from Norwegian celebrities and players the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them IF Youre EVER GONNA SEE A NORWEGIAN MOVIE LET IT BE THIS ONE!!!!
I hate football!! I hate football fans! I hate cars! but this film was the funniest thing I have seen in quite some time br br I was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend and all I have to say is I laughed till I cried and when is it going to be available in the UK and Denmark Girls this is one football film you will need to see its hilarious!br br The fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing the guys may not be well known actors but this is good down to earth real humour with real people and I for one applaud them for taking this to the screenbr br WELL DONE!
Hehehe This was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed so I fell out of the chair With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves Harald Zwart is the producer known for films like Agent Cody banks and of course One Night at McCoolsbr br It is about Norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in Soccer in Germany 2006 And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it It was hilarious I couldnt stop laughing I havent had so much fun in ages Rumors say it will come a number two but I do not know It will be hard beating this one br br recommended to everyone! It is a must see film I was suppose to see it at the cinema but I had work at the times it where shown And been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out Got it today on DVD Well worth it
Ive been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80s I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff a genre Im not particularly interested in The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense no doubt only to its Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood The scenery (the beautiful Philippines) soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today It is truly one of my great guilty pleasures I was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than I think is healthy A worthwhile moodpiece
Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi this film doesnt quite reach the level of Joe DAmatos similar efforts while staying just about as trashy The author of the original book Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman Emmanuelle Arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young Annie Belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations Her boyfriend played by ZOMBIEs Al Cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married! Orso Maria Guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by Arsan herself Despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye?  I can see you better naked! the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less-than-spectacular finale Much like DAmatos EMANUELLE AND THE LAST CANNIBALS the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but dont get your hopes up theres no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter Just a lot of nudity and silly dialog I couldnt help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by
Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventuresex movie She wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum She and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical Asian paradise They have decided to keep an open sexual relationship which is played out on their journey to find a secret societytribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony The scenery is gorgeous deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored The imagery is very similar to that of the movie Black Emanuelle It is rich and colorful Recommended!
I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it Whats great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesnt really matter The pace in languid and the settings are exotic The film has a lot going for it Unfortunately it also has a few things going against it The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability According to IMDb Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screenbr br The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous Theres one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest Ive ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter in mid-air And Al Cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! I kid you not Ridiculous We later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola While the footage rolls Al and Annie start making out This scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much Watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman while piloting a helicopter no less Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene I just wish the footage on the editing screen wasnt so sillybr br Speaking of drag another dull plot point in LAURE which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives A married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting The two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex In fact Orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film even when hes with Annie Belle This is another minor complaint about LAURE: theres nudity but its not as much as other films of the same era It just needed more skin to punch it upbr br Except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments LAURE is actually very watchable I love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere not the crude stuff we see todaybr br ps: make sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt which stars Annie & Al but also another famous screen couple Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti The music in that movie is also great

Distributor: GOODTIMES home video br br Plot: A pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for TV movie Gail Osborne is new in town She makes friends has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way That is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting After more and more phone calls she is raped throughout most of the movie she tries to find proof that the person did rape herbr br AudioVideo: This 1987 VHS edition from Goodtimes stinks There are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screenbr br Extras: No extras from Goodtimes home videobr br Final thoughts: This suspense filled made for TV movie was made in 1978 so dont expect many deaths (there are none) If you can find this movie with the Worldvision home video logo on the front then buy it But the Goodtimes version is pretty crappy This can be a little boring but if you are patient the ending is pretty good
There is a lot to like in this film despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim The movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes (I for one was sure it was the teacher In fact that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friends boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere I guess the point of that is that rape is omnipresent You never know who it is going to be) Ms Beller is luminous as always (yet see KB discussion board for my qualification of this statement) Like all preachy films the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point Unless you are really curious to find out what happens to Phillip Blythe Danner as the mom is in the role she was born to play: the fretting over-protective mom Some good 70s scenes for 70s fans (The dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark-stained beams barrels oak and cork) A must for Beller fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s High School melodrama or 70s kitsch in general
Are You in the House Alone? belongs to the pre-cable TV days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows It is well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations Kathleen Beller plays a High School student who gets a series of threatening letters Everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but Beller is really scared Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Bellers parents Ellen Travolta (Johns sister) is the High School Principal and Dennis Quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid Its a competent chiller with a still relevant social message Beller is lovely - if you are 30 or older you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters Blythe Danner who I usually dont like gives a truly moving performance Nice little film
Okay I love this movie!!!!! I watched it over and over again It is so hard to tell who the attacker is You keep thinking its one person then another then back to the first person then another person It is so suspense full you want to fast forward your TV to the end to see who it isbr br SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at her home She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped It goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend to her teacher who takes a liking to her to her ex-boyfriend all different stories all suspects But who did it?br br I love the acting they have a lot of great talent in here The suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb If it comes on TV watch it  12 stars 1010

An enjoyable movie without a doubt and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boys rites of passage But I have to say that having read the very positive comments here I was a bit disappointed The period was captured but the plot was desperately thin The whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns but a philanderer is risible And without that nada The sub-plots bore no relation that I could see to the main plot - all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story - which surely suggests a fundamental flaw When all your sub-plots look like padding you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits Nevertheless its a benign movie with its heart in the right place there are some fine performances and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final cut! That good feeling permeates the film And that has to count for something A flawed really quite good movie 7 out of 10
I was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was The school play where the leading actors kiss that happened at my school A crazy gang of lads my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke! Getting the whack some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes! after that they were kept in a safe!!! And as for certain nocternal activities! what can I say The film actually came out in 1982 I remember that as it was when I bought my house and the film was showing at the same time If you like British films and films about school growing up and period pieces then this is for you Another film very much like it SWALK came out a few years before and I for one would like to see that again also Kes is in the genre Highly recommended (But trust me 1982 is when it came out)
Although i dont like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago I still think it is one of the best coming-of-age movies i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch I saw the opening titles of that movie and theni was so immersed in it that i felt i was there it really affected me personally i still remember how i felt when i first saw it i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a shy boy fantasizing about kissing his dream girl no offense but if that was an American movie you would certainly see-at a certain point mainly climax- the shy boy making love to his girl and i really cant grasp this contradicting concepts till nowi have a simple request if anyone knows how to get this movie on a DVD by mail please let me know cause i need a shot of memoriesThanks
Postwar England the dawn of the atomic age Yet the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first kiss cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as THE BOMB This was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of thebr br 1940s Free of political correctness and preachy messages this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind (andbr br hormones) of a young teenager can create Wonderful subplotsbr br maintain character interest ala Gregorys Girl and plentybr br of well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era This is a very good story for anyone young or old who hasbr br ever been in love or ever wanted to be Does he ever get his wish? Watch it and see
There is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around  that 20 years later  it wont hold the same magic as it did before I must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised Ptang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old This film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess It is engrossing  it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttendens rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now I urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me PTANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10
Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series published in 1981 it was not available on DVD until the last few years Since then it has become available but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an international DVD player which you have to hack--illegally I suspect to see it) but the series is now available through amazoncom--3 discs-- for between $19-21 to be viewed on DVD in the US format no hacking There were 41 reviews average 5 stars This mini-series is one of the very best on Oppenheimer or the Manhattan Project or virtually anything produced by the BBC
Like an earlier commentor I saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story splendid acting and dramatic musical score It certainly contains some of Sam Waterstons finest work He and the writers depict Oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero -- which he was -- but also as naive fond of alcohol and snobbish a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype
 Great News there is a BBC DVD release scheduled for 31st July 2006UK - there is also a scheduled release in States - dont know the date - cant wait ! ! br br  below is my original comment br br I agree with all the other reviewers - it is simply staggering that one of the greatest TV dramas ever has never been released on DVDbr br The story line is gripping - the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling !br br Over here in the UK we have quite a history of getting TV drama series and films out onto DVD through popular campaigns br br Its very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a DVD production ? Im going to e:mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens Who did the production ? was it BBC ? RW
Insanely well crafted mini-seriesbr br I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS Was heavily promoted at the time I believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater seriesbr br The full length production was shown I believe only once during its first broadcast Was 6-8 hours total This length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours Cut some interesting but slow scenesbr br I am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete not edited version to DVD Not worth creating a VHS version at this pointbr br Would fit in very well in the mini-series or dramatic history genre
Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (it was the first thing I saw Waterston in) and it is too bad copies arent available A similar situation exists for Glory Enough for All a British series from around the same time about the discovery of insulin I would pay a good price for both of these on DVD Is it really so difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that is able to be played in the US? Another very enjoyable series again from about the same time was Danger UXB A series about defusing UneXploded Bombs hence the name That one you can get from your local librarybr br Pete
Oppenheimer with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest Well written well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters highly informative and very entertaining The set designs and costumes capture the feel of the US during World War 2 and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at Los Alamos and caught up in the excitement of the Manhattan Project The only downside is that this is a British production and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing American accent (The skill of current day Australian & Irish actors taking on non-native dialects is amazing) The storyline is fully consistent with Richard Rhodes definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb Sadly the mini-series was shown only a couple of times on PBS at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivionbr br Oppenheimer compares favorably to the more recent Fat Man & Little Boy feature film with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (the chronically overweight and rather homely General would be thoroughly flattered) and Dwight Schultz (alumnus of TVs A-Team) as Oppenheimer As a mini-series Oppenheimer is around 4x as long as the Newman feature but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage
President Harry S Truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the history you dont knowbr br Seven years before Richard Rhodes superb Pulitzer Prize-winning The Making of the Atomic Bomb the BBC produced a seven-part miniseries Oppenheimer that was a character study of the people who designed and built the weapon that ushered in the Atomic Age permanently joining science and technology to the state (and in particular the military) not merely making history but changing the world foreverbr br The production is impeccable the casting nothing short of miraculous; not only the main characters but even secondary characters bear uncanny resemblances to the persons portrayed In particular are Sam Waterston in the title role of American physicist J Robert Oppenheimer scientific director of the Manhattan Project who was based at the Los Alamos NM laboratory (the site for which he personally chose); Manning Redwood as General Leslie R Groves who oversaw the entire Manhattan Engineering District (the projects formal name); David Suchet as physicist and ultimate nemesis of Oppenheimer Edward Teller (who nearly forty years later whispered into Ronald Reagans ear and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - Star Wars) and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer The attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughoutbr br Part thriller part love story - and ultimately a tragedy this series faithfully recreates a chapter in world history - and that of science - that we dare not forget Highest recommendationbr br (NOTE: Viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy Jacob Bronowskis 13-part series The Ascent of Man and the BBC film of Michael Frayns play Copenhagen)
I too found Oppenheimer to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on American PBS David Suchet was particularly effective as Edward Teller as I recall and the overall conception was spectacularly good The only reason that the series doesnt rate a full 1010 is for the low-budget production values in some areas Actual content is absolutely first-rate in my recollectionbr br The Oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the UK on July 31st! It will be a Region 2PAL set but it would seem that a Region 1NTSC set should be soon in the offingbr br If you have a universal player in the US you can order the series right now from Amazon UKbr br http:tinyurlcomznyyqbr br Huzzah!!
I cant remember the series I believe it may have been American Masters but it was broadcast on PBS around 1980 Most people have some knowledge of the development of the A bomb and those that have little or none probably think it is a pretty dry subject Anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way You get to know the turmoil in Oppenhemiers mind and how the development changed his life forever You understand the tragic figure he became and why With 7 episodes you get to know the major players and the intrigue and backstabbing I have contacted PBS about the chance of obtaining a video or DVD but have never received a response Too bad I would love to see it again
I watched this mini in the early eighties Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor In fact when he began Law and Order I was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role Unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it It is both factual and entertaining Everyone should see it to know what really happened I was so moved I purchased and read the book Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds And saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight If you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance Mr Waterston can really provide an audience Enjoy the movies!
Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV It was both entertaining and informative The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how I can again see itbr br In the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with Gen Leslie Groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the Manhattan Project Most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past br br The casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding It was the first time that I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor Except for height he looked very much like Robert Oppenheimerbr br The early scene in which Oppenheimer is leading a class of graduate students was especially intriguing to me
I saw this series on PBS in 1980 in college and I still cant get it out of my head although I have never seen it since I remember every cast member (the casting WAS perfect as mentioned in other comments) the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set Probably the best TV series I ever saw next to the original Roots
I posted on IMDb on this series recently giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to appeal release I wrote to that address mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity prominently I just received the following reply: br br From: emilyfussell@hotmailcom Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT To: kk2840@earthlinknet br br Dear Kate br br I work for the BBFC the British equivalent to the MPAA and we classify DVDs and videos as well as films in this country Anyway I am currently in the process of giving a certificate to the 1980 miniseries Oppenheimer While researching the work on the IMDb I noticed your post and thought you might like to know that the work is about to be released (hence the need for a certificate) br br I dont know which company is distributing it but keep your eyes peeled! br br Kind regards br br Emily +++++++++++++++++ br br hooray! br br I also want to contact Netflix re purchasing this br br Kate Killebrew br br kk2840@earthlinknet I emailed the BBC recently regarding whether their terrific series Oppenheimer had ever been released on video or DVD I have not been able to find it I received the following reply If you do write the BBC be sure to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the US You can also enter Oppenheimer (1980) on amazoncom and find a box to check to request release by the owner (BBC) and be notified when its released br br Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlinknetbr br Heres the reply from the BBC:br br Dear Katebr br Thank you for your e-mail regarding Oppenheimerbr br I was interested to read that you would like a copy of this programme which you have enjoyed I have checked the BBC Shop and on-line retailers and can find no record of it being available We are unaware of plans at present to release this programme on DVD However if you would like to make a suggestion can I suggest you put it in writing to the commercial arm of the BBC:br br Commissioning Editor BBC Worldwide Ltd Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TTbr br May I thank you again for taking the time to contact the BBCbr br Regardsbr br Elaine Hunter BBC Information ______________________________________br br -----Original Message-----br br {Comments:} i am trying to find a copy of the terrific BBC production Oppenheimer a six part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston from a bookscript by Peter Prince I watched parts of it then on PBS American Playhouse but cant find it on video anywherebr br http:wwwbbccouk
a true geek-girls dream: high tech high drama smart guys steamy sex and large explosions (VERY large explosions) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that tapes of the REAL Oppenheimer sound odd: apparently he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the 20th centurys most stirring dramas and this movie stands as a model of what docu-drama ought to be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record not to call attention to themselves An interesting fact: some of the technical details used had only recently been declassified and so are of special interest A must-see!
Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet? I can see that a lot of people have inquired but I cant tell if any of them have been successful Its hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country How can this be true and what can we do to change it? As an aside I agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site This is an excellent story about events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today Lots of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway Now we want to share it with our children  but we cant? If that is true what would some good written materials be that would relay the same information?
This is the best work i have ever seen on television The story is compelling--all the more so because it is true The writers did their homework--the accuracy of events is well documented The acting is great This has to be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had And the black and white cinematography was exceptional My only regret is that it is not available to buy A few years ago I contacted someone involved with the production (either with PBS or in England) and was told they had no plans to release it on VHS (at the time) This was a BBC production and ran in the US on American Playhouse There is such an interest in seeing this--just hard to believe no one can make it available
Ive always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was perhaps the hardest working lead actress of the 30s and 40s although few of her movie roles are memorable Today she is remembered most for the TV show The Big Valley Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presencebr br And so it was for Christmas in Connecticut a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isnt even really about Christmas It does however have Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some supreme character actors including Sydney Greenstreet and SK Sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today To begin the plot concerns a magazine writer (Stanwyck) who the magazines readers believe is a domestic goddess married with a child and living on a farm in Connecticut but who is really single lives in New York City and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking Could anyone get away with such a fraud even then? Apparently and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and Stanwyck Greenstreet a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan) and Stanwycks restaurateur friend (SZSakall) find themselves spending Christmas in Connecticut at a farm belonging to Stanwycks boorish boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner) You can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all Morgan and Stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married Regardless they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh Meanwhile the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who has seen Stanwyck and Morgan go off together but still doesnt get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwindbr br At this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd not funny haha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did The good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever afterbr br I watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with Barbara Stanwyck Thank goodness it was set at Christmas or like 95 percent of Stanwycks movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew
While its not perfect its close Love Barbara Stanwyck SZ Sakall Sidney Greenstreet Dennis Morgan Robert Shayne (Supermans police chief) the housekeeper the waiter at Restaurant Felix and the judgeI can go on and on This movie has been part of my familys holiday tradition since I was a youngster and my children grew up with it too! The baby swallowed the watch was always my sons favorite linebr br Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly funny S Z Sakall Dennis Morgan has a few great songs toobr br I highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake (blah)
I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment isnt married and doesnt have a baby - and cant cook at all! Hilarity (and romance) ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face keep from being fired by the magazine owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet) This is a delightful comedy; one that I highly recommend to classic movie lovers!!!!
Barbara Stanwyck probably didnt think of it but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle (if it wasnt a wig) than the one she had to wear in Double Indemnity the year before That film while the premiere film noir and an all-around great film gave her a great role but oh that hair Here she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal but she is certainly a 40s woman She has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war and as a successful Martha Stewart like columnist she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is We meet her boss Sydney Greenstreet who has no idea that she is living a lie and when he pushes his way in for a Christmas away at her supposed Connecticut home she has to come up with a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say Jingle Bells Hungarian chef SZ Sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one-on-one with Irish Una OConnor Its not Goulash Its Irish Stew Sakall simply takes the paprika pours most of it in and says Now its goulash totally changing what she has prepared for lunch Then when it comes to the flapjacks he flips and she scoops For years a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation I dont flip I scoop! She wont even flip just one for Greenstreet saying Ive never flipped in me life OConnor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films but here she is delightfully lovable and her pairing with Sakall is very charmingbr br It is obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwycks cup of tea especially when she meets handsome Dennis Morgan who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby which eats soap causing Stanwyck to get a bit alarmed He should suspect something instantly but doesnt But it doesnt matter The film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow an abundance of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of New York State made me miss this kind of Christmas While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is exsquisit too there is something about looking out at a snow-covered field of trees and catch an occasional glimpse of deer rabbits or other wild lifebr br This is a great holiday film that can also bring on the Christmas spirit out of season and makes a great pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck country Christmas film Remember the Night an underrated gem Add on the big city Christmas of Meet John Doe and youve found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around
Ive discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise A Christmas Classicits also one of the fine comedies of the 40s The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine At Christmas time her boss Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about The only problem is : She hasnt got any farm and she cant cook To get out of the jam Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardinerwho has a farm) and flies for Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix br br Theres a fine direction by Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful : Stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman Greenstreet Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters The only weak point is the leading man Dennis Morgan He starts well but as the movie goes on becomes really a bore One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to ends up with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven who both would have been more suitable for the part Anyway this is a joyful Christmas time movie with a refreshing score and I advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet Holidaysin Connecticut
A magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a NY apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her After a slow start it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy thanks to a fine cast In a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in Double Indemnity Stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair Morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while Greenstreet is well cast as the publisher However Sakall steals the film as a chef trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent
This film reminds me very much of the later Rock Hudson film MANS FAVORITE SPORT--about a fishing writer who has NEVER fished and is forced into entering a fishing tournament In this case Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart-like writer who cant cook and doesnt really have the perfect family she describes in her articles--in fact she has no family at all Well like Rock she is maneuvered into performing--in this case creating a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the countryside Since there is no family she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tried desperately NOT to let the cat out of the bag that she cant do any of the things she is known for doing A cute little comedy and a welcome film to the annual holiday film lineup
Add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars It isbr br sweet funny and endearing
This is a delightful they-dont-make-em-like-this-anymore kind of film Well performed by everyone and peopled with interesting character actors An intelligent witty script acted with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor Holds up for repeated (annual?) viewingsbr br WARNING the re-make of this film with the same name directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking is an unbearable mess - painful to watch - without a scintilla of the charm and wit of the original
Christmas In Connecticut is a gem of a Christmas movie classic While lesser known than some others -- it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time I watch it every yearbr br Barbara Stanwyck is perfectly cast as Elizabeth Lane the single career girl Way before it was popular Stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise Her NYC apartment and her friendly uncle restaurateur around the corner typify the single girl in the city existence She cant cook yet she writes a homemaking column for a magazine!br br Dennis Morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero Jefferson Jones who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane After being lost at sea all he wants is to spend Christmas in a real home Which sets up the delightful madcap story that evolves It is fun from beginning to end We should all have an Uncle Felix too!
Christmas in Connecticut is an absolute gem and a must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane a precursor to Martha Stewart is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife mother and domestic goddess Only thing is she is none of these things--a total phony Unfortunately for her she is about to be found out Her publisher Mr Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic turn by Sydney Greenstreet) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeths perfect farm for the Christmas holiday Only thing there is no farm perfect or otherwise The comedy involves how Elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job Elizabeths colleague John happens to have a farm in Connecticut so that solves that problem However he wants to marry Liz but she does not want to marry him He offers her marriage though he knows she doesnt feel the same way about him that he does about her He makes the offer anyway and assures her that he is willing to wait And here Barbara Stanwyck as Liz delivers one of the most devastating put-downs I have ever heard With perfect innocence she replies: Could you wait that long? OUCH! In addition the scenes between Una OConner and SZ Sakall are hilarious They dont seem to like one another (though one suspects they really do) They are rivals in the household and SZ Sakalls mangled English is equaled by Noras strangled pronunciation of his name (Mr Basternook) My name is FELIX! It is amazing how Christmas-y these black and white films are Great character work by all involved Dont miss this one!
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of Dickens Christmas Carol in its sensibility The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens Scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees -- until the Christmas spirit overtakes him The role is a walk in the park for Greenstreet who had been one of the stages great Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts company Greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when at age 61 he was featured in what was to become a film classic the first and best film John Huston ever directed: The Maltese Falcon Cuddles Sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of middle European gemutlicheit The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem
I just got this movie for Christmas and have already added it to my favorites list A cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie Who could not love Uncle Felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food Definite points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander Yardley and also to Reginald Gardiner who played John Sloane the impossibly boring fiancee Truly a gem to be watched every Christmas
I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films As you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it br br Stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts Dennis Morgans acting is strong also He goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor check out KITTY FOYLE In this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos Stanwyck away from her husband to be br br This is a Christmas classic The settings and the story make for a great Christmas romance
Though its a Christmas movie Christmas in Connecticut could have been done any time of year as its the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type Thats what he thinks In reality the lady in question portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby She has no farm no husband and no baby nor are the many recipes she publishes hers They belong to the restaurant owner nearby When her no-nonsense editor Sydney Greenstreet insists that she entertain soldier Dennis Morgan she enlists the aid of her boyfriend to use his farm and she transports herself and the restaurateur there Theres even a babywell actually theres more than one Chaos ensues and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morganbr br This is such a wonderful movie and even if youre gravely depressed Christmas in Connecticut can lift you right out of it Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned homemaker Despite not being as flashy as Crawford or Davis she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for - she could be cheap elegant warm nasty cold andor sexy and she makes it look easy On top of that she is always attractive and alluring Dennis Morgan is a handsome and charming solider; as an added bonus he gets to use his Irish tenor Fiancé Reginald Gardner is all business and you can tell hes not quite right for Stanwyck SZ Sakall as the fake unclereal chef is hilarious especially as he prays Stanwyck can flip a pancake before an audiencebr br I can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of World War II It must have been a real beacon for the better times to come
This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite which I try to catch on TV every year if I can It revolves around a Martha Stewart like journalist named Elizabeth Lane charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck However in contrast to Martha this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever The other cast members effectively complete the story and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones) Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan) and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley)br br Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children In reality she is a single woman living in a New York City apartment and cannot boil an egg Her recipes are borrowed from her Hungarian chef friend Felix Elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine Alexander Yardley decides he wants a nice old fashioned country Christmas and invites himself to visit her bringing with him a returning war hero Jefferson Jones a sailor who had been shipwrecked Yardley demands total honesty of his employees To get out of her predicament and save her deception based career Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor John Sloan a dull fussy chap who has long sought marriage She also borrows a neighbours baby (actually several) to pass off as her own and her husband Sloansbr br Of course this scenario makes for much merriment Its a screwball comedy and a charming romance with the added attraction of a Christmas atmosphere Whenever I think of this movie I picture the snowflakes falling the tree beautifully decorated the fire roaring in the hearth the turkey roasting and Christmas cookies bakingbr br Why did Hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? I understand there is a 1992 version directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and starring Dyan Cannon Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis I have not seen this modern adaptation nor do I wish to This old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday must see along with Its a Wonderful Life White Christmas Miracle on 34th Street and of course all the versions of A Christmas Carol
I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favoritesit has all the charm 1940s quaintness and good old fashioned romance and its hilarious to boot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazineunder the premise that she is a married homemaker Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion Enter a handsome GI (played by the talented Dennis Morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy His simple wish is to stay at the homey Inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home-cooked meals She now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputationadd to this that her fiancé is in a hurry to tie the knot doesnt help The humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun Throw in the character-actor nicknamed Cuddles (who fits this name completely) it becomes even more adorable This has become my must-see movie that I snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each Christmas season A wonderful enjoyable movie to enjoy at Christmastime or anytime!
Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writers family at her farm in Connecticut The problem is she has no husband baby or farm as she writes about in her column and she cant even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend  Uncle Felix owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York Citybr br Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas A scheme is hastily planned with her stuffy fiancé providing an actual Connecticut farm neighbors providing a borrowed baby and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isnt looking But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve romantic complications ensue as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy Navy man and vice versabr br This is a charming warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent aided by such marvelous character actors as Sydney Greenstreet Una OConnor SZSakall and many others A Christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough bitchy women in femme fatale roles Truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time
